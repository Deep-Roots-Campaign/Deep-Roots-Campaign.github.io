Perhaps it was sentimentality reigning supreme and making my admiration so overt...<br>The impracticality of the path's structure unfortunately meant one of the carts got stuck, and not long after, one of us fell and injured herself.

What a sight! I've never seen earth float so high, over a vast ocean many leagues below. The sky was bluer than any crystal I've ever laid eyes upon, and the clouds in the distance towered to mind-boggling heights, appearing reflections of ice-capped mountain peaks. The trees on the floating islands produced songs with the shifting winds. Turns out they have holes in their trunks – who would have thought?!<br>As my awe subsided into relief, Vigil sought me out to give me a parting gift: an amber pendant of warmth, to keep the cold of the Nordthorn mountains – my next destination – at bay. He won't be joining me there; other destinations await him. I don't know if the battle, the gesture or both have instilled me with a sadness to part ways with him, but I hope to see him again someday.<br>For now, I must find myself either a kite to glide down to Nordthorn at the risk of plummeting to my death, or find passage on a ship …","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 0.5","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 0.5"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/hallowhymn/hallowhymn.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html","Stox","Vigil"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-0.5.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707150473000,"modifiedTime":1719929951284,"sourceSize":2725,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 0.5.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-0.5.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-0.56.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 0.56","icon":"","description":"<br>Session log for Aeren's 2nd session, with @zaqurie's Bell :sparkles: <br>Today was not the quiet trek towards the tower I had expected.

Arcana never was my strong suit.<br>After briefly lamenting the fact I could not more thoroughly investigate this tower so similar to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Lady Sunnis\" data-href=\"Lady Sunnis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Sunnis\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sunnis</a>’ back in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sandfall City\" data-href=\"Sandfall City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandfall</a>, my newfound companion and I ventured on and up the mountain. There, we found the entrance to a cavern of sorts.<br>The stranger seemed unsettled by it, but it was certain death under a thick blanket of snow, or braving the possibility of it in this game. We chose the latter.<br>Inside, we found two cultists – at least, I think they were. We observed quietly from a height along a ledge as they performed their ritual about a large sigil on the cavern floor, decorated with <a data-href=\"Draconic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/draconic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Draconic</a> sigils. Fitting, then, that they later also spoke Draconic to each other. I also noticed a stone door of sorts on the wall directly below the drop.<br>My companion and I before long decided on a two-pronged approach to figure out what was happening. I tried distracting them – clumsily – with conversation, while my companion circled around the other side.<br>He, however, decided to end my evident uncertainty and propel things onwards by somehow conjuring a massive iron door, and dropping it on them. Needless to say, they were unhappy with us for that. I'll spare myself the ink by stating we overpowered the two as they attempted to complete the ritual hastily.<br>We found a league of items on their bodies. One of them held a light crossbow + 20 bolts, light leather armour, a scimitar, dagger ( silver filigree-covered , both blade and hilt ), the scrap of paper he’d been clinging to – with an alphabet I don’t understand –, a rough sort of circle with notes indicating different parts of the sigil on the floor. Also a half dozen empty vials, a dark brown stain in them; like they once contained blood.<br>The other held similar items, except his dagger was obsidian. We unmasked the cultists, one of them a high-elf, and the other a dwarf. On the latter, we found remnants of a tattoo below his neck, between the shoulder blades. It was a circular pattern with curved, jagged lines, reminiscent of a sun with an empty centre, or a whirlpool of sorts. Perhaps it was even a directional guide of sorts?<br>We examined the door as well, but I can’t read the writing on it, nor could I open it. However, after contemplating for a while as we rested, I am almost certain the writing is also draconic. Shrines in the temple in Sandfall displayed this script, and these were dedicated to (allegedly) one of the first dragons to ever exist.<br>My companion and I parted ways as the storm died down, and he was kind enough to gift me some gold for the road ahead.<br>So, in short, it seems we stumbled upon a dragon-worshipping cult of sorts. I’m not entirely sure how this ties in to the eight ( or nine, I suppose ) towers, if it at all. Maybe I’m imagining things, but it all seems too odd to be a mere coincidence. I’ll have to think on the matter a while longer …","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 0.56","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 0.56"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["Vigil","languages/dwarvish.html","Lady Sunnis","locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html","languages/draconic.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-0.56.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707151002000,"modifiedTime":1717087661097,"sourceSize":4224,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 0.56.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-0.56.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-0.57.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 0.57","icon":"","description":"<br>Session log for Aeren's 3rd session, with Corvaux!<br>Day 19 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age.<br>Two days ago, on the 17th, I set out along the <a data-href=\"Ghastbane Cliffs\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Ghastbane Cliffs\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ghastbane Cliffs</a>, my home for the past decade, in pursuit of insight into the reports of trees and other flora having been destroyed beyond repair. The Moonshade moss has been flourishing, at least — I remember wondering if that might have to do <a data-href=\"Lucanthus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lucanthus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lucanthus</a>’s turquoise shine during its rotation across the sky, before I came across a mangled tree at last.<br>It was as though a massive paw had crushed it. Large, wide-footed tracks of some beast with four legs led this way and that around it. Something reptilian came through this way … I couldn’t stop to consider it for long, as a shrill whistling noise passed overhead, and the earth trembled with a force I’ve not felt the immense rock slides and avalanches I witnessed in the northern mountain peaks of <a data-href=\"Nordthorn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordthorn</a>.<br>The only thing there was to do, was to follow the quaking to its source, farther towards <a data-href=\"Baheera\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Baheera</a> still. A pile of boulders that have never once moved in all the times I have crossed this area, has shifted, revealing odd markings. In hindsight, I wish I could have more closely examined them — but the gaping hole in the ground some ways off more urgently called for my attention.<br>A cloud of ash (I assume) hung all over and about it. It was so dense at first, I didn’t even notice the person hiding below it, before going off the examine the odd, feather-like patterns the ash seemed to fall into on the ground.<br>The stranger, <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>, revealed herself to me. I admit, I thought her a strange one at first, speaking of delusions — assuming I was a delusion, and one of ‘the wrong kind of yellow’ at that! She seemed unfamiliar with even the most mundane parts of this world. The sky, the sun, the concept of rain and rivers — all new to her. Surely enough, she revealed she isn’t from here, and doesn’t quite know how she got here, either.<br>But things got more interesting, still. Again I heard the noise and felt the trembling, and Corvaux and I set out together to chase it to its source (as I did not wish to leave her behind here). We come across a river, plummeting down a waterfall. I know this area well, but not the odd creatures populating the area. At first glance, they seemed a simple bear and a toad, but they shone with a yellow, powdery substance I could not place …<br>The bear was not responsive to my magic in the sense that I’m used to, either. Where I would usually be able to have some semblance of a conversation with a bear such as itself, this one simply parroted my words right back to me. Corvaux revealed her suspicions as my unease grew: these animals were infected with something she’s witnessed in her home.<br>We couldn’t let these animals go unchecked, and let this infection spread. Though it pained me at first to kill these creatures, it turned out they were no animals at all — I don’t know what to call them, still, but they were insectoid … unknowns. They dissolved after the fight, leaving but their yellow stains on the ground.<br>Unfortunately, one of them got to me; infected me with its poison. The itch all throughout my body was indescribable, and I don’t know if I’d have ever gotten rid of it without Corvaux’s help. She brewed an antidote of Moonshade (or Moonshadow!) moss – or two, actually – and taught me the recipe for it. It should serve as protection from any future poisoning if imbibed ahead of time, too.<br>Once I’d recovered enough to carry on, we decided to excavate the infected soil and deposit it in a wheelbarrow. There was no knowing whether it might spread through the ground, and that was not a risk I was willing to take. We depart towards the <a data-href=\"Circle of Seven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Circle of Seven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of Seven</a> to find my peers that have specialised in purification rituals and the like, so they may learn of this new threat and find out how to prevent its spread, should the worst come to pass and more of these creatures turn out to be about.<br>Along the way, we felt and heard another rumble and for a moment, the sun disappeared from the sky. Something flew overhead, something massive, holding what turned out to be buildings in its mighty claws! Corvaux recovered a piece of paper that fell from one such building and recognised the script as Draconic. The creature, meanwhile, ventured farther south and into Baheera. I feared for <a data-href=\"Tornwing Haven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Tornwing Haven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tornwing Haven</a>’s safety, so we sped there as fast as we could without throwing about the infected soil.<br>Thankfully, the settlement was unharmed, but its citizens were disturbed by the sighting I just described. Little did they know of my (and likely Corvaux’s?!) suspicions that this incident and the infection must be related to each other. Coincidences exist, but none of this magnitude. They can’t.<br>At length, we started gathering more information about what the locals saw. I reached out to my circle and local clerics to help us cleanse the earth. Meanwhile, I took what time in between I had to recover from my wounds and monitor the purification of the earth. Corvaux passed on the recipe for the antidote, and shortly after, we set off into the Baheera desert to seek more answers.<br>So far, we’ve been led to a place that is believed cursed.

It was the first actual settlement I'd seen in days – that is, a settlement with solid buildings, rather than yurts and tents belonging to nomads.<br>Given the relentlessness of the sun beating down us the past couple of days, Corvaux and I made way for a tavern (<a data-href=\"Serenity's Rest\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Serenity's Rest\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Serenity's Rest</a>) to rest up, first of all. As luck would have it, we wound up stumbling head first into gossip about precisely our topic of interest: the nearby ruins. Other people have already beaten us to them. There is now a massive digsite, apparently, with interested parties having themselves lowered into the ground to discover whatever relics they might find there.<br>Corvaux and I had our meals and drinks first, and with by some good fortune and a few ales, we managed to strike up a useful (and pleasant!) conversation with some other patrons. They told us of the history of this oasis; of how it used to span many more miles across, until a magic cataclysm of sorts sent fire raining from the skies, and set the town aflame. Only this small part of the former grand town is now inhabited. People here do not view magic favourably as a result, and avoid the remnants of the burnt down parts of the settlement almost as a form of superstition.<br>Good, now that we have that bit of interesting context out of the way, and I know to keep my casting to a minimum: the dragon we've been chasing, crash-landed just outside the village.

He spoke about sandstorms, too – we need to ask the <a data-href=\"Duskwardens\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Duskwardens\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Duskwardens</a> about those for any details, so that's what Corvaux and I set out to do once our tankards had run dry.<br>We meet someone named <a data-href=\"Jalis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Jalis\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jalis</a> by the entrance. Inside of the tower, we saw massive sheets of canvas, depicting basic maps of the settlement. Differently coloured ribbons and strings, red here, blue there, depict weather patterns across them. They're not too dissimilar from diagrams my circle used to predict the weather.<br>Having taken in these maps, I'll have a better understanding of what to expect when we're out in the desert once more. I also see a storm is approaching, set to reach these parts some hours after tomorrow's dawn. By early afternoon, we'll be unable to move through it without risking our lives, and these circumstances will not wane for another two to four days. Corvaux and I had best set out overnight.<br>Jalis told us at least fifty people have already passed through the settlement to visit the ruins. She also tells us about what we might expect when we make our way there, too – such as strange moving lightning; balls that descend from the sky remain in place until someone comes close enough for them to strike. Sometimes, they descend into the sands only to never be seen again, resulting in the surrounding sands becoming electrified. If encountered, we should cast some type of counterspell upon sight or prepare ourselves to be exposed to their charge.<br>We’ll also find mephits, and, if we're not careful, ravenous sands …<br>Jalis eventually suggested one of the Duskwardens join us as a guide:<br>\n<br>Nahiri Swiftpaws, one of the Tabaxi locals.\n<br><a data-href=\"Grunk the Mighty\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/grunk-the-mighty.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grunk the Mighty</a>, a lizardfolk person.\n<br>They can be found in the temple or serenity’s rest.

Before we even set out, though, a great beam of golden light came down into the desert (or was it going up from the desert?). The locals told us it apparently meant someone was in the ruins of the south side of the old city — more specifically in the 'testing tower’, attempt to … well, take its tests. I still wonder if this somehow relates to the lit towers of <a data-href=\"Nordthorn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordthorn</a> …<br>Either way, we set out as intended on our 3 - 4 hour hike once Grunk was ready to go, intent on reaching our destination before the morning's sandstorm would roll in. But we got curious about the light, of course, so we asked Grunk to take a detour with us towards that light. He told us that there where the light touched down, the temple of <a data-href=\"Hystaa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/hystaa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hystaa</a>, goddess of Justice, lies. Apparently, the light served as a ‘bell gong’ for Hystaa's clerics and other devotees. The tower is meant to judge whether the temple's visitors are worthy of entrance into its archives.<br>Just as we approached the tower, we crossed paths with another traveller — a dragonborn of some noble standing. <a data-href=\"Lady Liatris\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Liatris\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Liatris</a>, she introduced herself as. She wound up joining us for the final stretch, and I must admit, I was rather content for it.<br>Before long we came across a tent pitched next to a barely opened well. Corvaux spotted a letter there, written by a <a data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus Quill</a>, requesting a rescue if he wasn't back by tomorrow (the 21st).<br>Lady Liatris managed to carve away some of the heavy, solid stone lid on the well, and Corvaux – with troublingly little forethought – decided to try climbing down the hole. We couldn't even see where it ended! What we also couldn't see was its taper. She could've plummeted to her death then and there!<br>Fortunately, she made it back out alive, after which I forced my climbing kit on her. Our minds had somehow gotten made up about one thing in the meantime: we did want to make our way down there. Especially Lady Liatris seemed intent on doing this, as she'd recognised the name on the letter.<br>After gracelessly shouting down the well, a small, red … dragon? shot up from the well and whizzed right past us, and what do you know? Mr Quill spoke to us through the little rascal! He tells us the way down is about 200 feet, so for those with no climbing kit, we decide to tie together all our ropes and Grunk makes a ladder of it.<br>He made an awful noise anchoring it to the stone, but given the lack of other options, I can't rightfully blame him. Either way, we all made our way down at length in various ways. Spiderwalk made it a smooth trek on my end, and fortunately permitted me to catch our dutiful guide mid-plummet down the hole. His hand must've cramped, or something …<br>We landed in a room with coloured, lit up circles on the ground and strange, red flowers around the edges. A single sheet of blank paper was left on a pedestal in the centre of the room. Upon investigation we realised we needed to sign our names on the paper – or otherwise identify ourselves, as one would in a guest book. A licked thumb was apparently enough, likewise Lady Liatris’ signet ring pressed into the paper with some blood of hers. This opened a door into a hallway, but not before another large beam of light shot up. That answered my question as to the precise origin of the light, at least.<br>Going through the door felt like passing through the portal in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sandfall City\" data-href=\"Sandfall City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandfall</a> … As I looked back to see if it was indeed a portal, a fresh, unblemished piece of paper sat on the pedestal. Interesting.<br>The next room had a table with all sorts of papers and scrolls on it. On the floor we also found a geometric pattern drawn with yellow paint. Not even a bird's eye view could help me recognise what it was meant to signify, unfortunately.<br>This left me with nothing to focus on but the table and everything strewn across it. All the scattered sheets reminded me of my father's the Stonecutter's journal. Different parchments textures, ages, styles of writing … a collection of oddities. Corvaux and I realised these were all personal accounts, knowledge, recipes, notations on maps, poems with annotations, et cetera.<br>Corvaux revealed we were meant to contribute to the collection with something personal of sorts. I drew Sandfall, adding notes here and there, and signed my initial below it.<br>Some 30 feet above, massive images suddenly appeared on the walls. A view of Sandfall from <a data-href=\"Lady Sunnis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Sunnis\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Sunnis</a>’ tower appears. It revealed metallic gleams and glints, showing the veins of metals and veins from city. On another wall, the <a data-href=\"Straterra University\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Straterra University\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Straterra University</a> which father helped build, with the Lapis Lazuli dome on display, encrusted with diamonds — just as magnificent as I remembered! Another wall depicts some of the more dangerous paths, with homes built into the cliff-walls that constantly fluctuate and shift under the element's force. I realise these are other people’s perspectives on my home …<br>The others see my entry only after they add their own to the pile, and vice versa.<br>In Lady Liatris’ ‘vision’, I recognise a portal to the Earth Plane. I'll have to ask her about that later – where exactly it was and what she might know of the portal and where precisely it leads, at least.<br>Grunk’s vision shows how not to die in the desert. Plain, but useful. The imagery teaches us of two different types of cactus: one is edible, one is poisonous.

The room itself held a statue of dragon on a basalt pedestal; no bigger than a wyrmling, with violet scales that refracted light, carved out of a single amethyst formation. Quite the stunning piece to look at!<br>According to Grunk, dragons ( as far as he's aware ) don't have any particular ties to <a data-href=\"Hystaa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/hystaa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hystaa</a> ( and I asked, as this is Hystaa's tower, after all ). They're known for their sense of justice, but other than that … nothing quite explicit.<br>In this same room, we also met up with <a data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus Quill</a> at last. We exchanged introductions, and come across draconic script at the base of the pedestal on which the statue is situated. A riddle, apparently: Enter and Wait, You Who Tempt Fate. Outlast or Outcast, Clever Hands Hold Fast.<br>We all decided to take a rest before proceeding, and I thought no more of it. I instead took to decrypting more of the Stonecutter's journal. This time, I asked Corvaux to help me.<br>Her unique linguistic capabilities and general eye for patterns helped me reach new insights. She noted the sheets are about finding someone, or perhaps a group of people – tracking a story, or rumours, about someone? A thief; a betrayer. The Infernal script apparently has a thing or two to say on those who break their promises. It's powerful; almost like a curse. Is the Stonecutter the betrayer in this story?<br>I'll have to find the answer another day (with Corvaux’s help, as she offered to teach me the language!), as we soon decided to head into the next room. There, we spot overlapping spiralling markings. Their light began pulsing, faster and faster, like something was counting down for us.<br>We all decided to wait until the light was barely flickering at all – then it brightened more still, while the room itself grew dimmer. The statue’s light behind us faded, and figures tall, lurching figures appeared atop the spirals. Their faces were like masks with too many eyes and rows of teeth. Their trinkets were reminiscent of those I saw in the fountain…<br>One of them reached towards Thaddeus, and before long a fight ( of sorts ) broke out. My attention was tugged back to my past by the mere gaze of one of these creatures, when I lived happily at home with my parents.<br>Suddenly, everything in the world seemed fine. I was pulled through time, rushing through events. I was trying to find the figure that took my eye in exchange for its gift, and the amber eye that replaced it … I wound up dwelling on it, relaxing from this combat, suddenly, thinking of the triumph and transformation. The connection then broke, and I lurched back into the present.<br>I soon realised these were people, or entities, from the <a data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Feywild</a>; Secret keepers.<br>They spawn and thrive in the deepest shadows of society, housing deception and obsession. The energy of that constant vigilance of all things social and the continuous nosing into all business can become strange, tangible aberrations. These aberrations keep searching for more to satiate their curiosity …<br>These Secret Keepers are pure magic beings, feeding off the energy of those around. They’re easily influenced by the atmosphere in which they live. I warned Lady Liatris of this, but she paid it no heed. Corvaux eventually pulled her out of one of the the Secret Keeper’s reach.<br>A minute and then some, and the creatures fade along with the light. The room regains its former, arguably more natural lighting.<br>Before long, though, Lady Liatris stepped into one of the circles and the lights change again, reminiscent of the bright hues of the portal from my home to <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>. Luca incanted and woke the portal with some components at the time, almost coaxing it to bathe us in its light.<br>I snapped out of my reminiscence as the two Secret Keepers showed up again. This is where I started thinking these bright, colourful circles might be portals, perhaps requiring a material component to be ‘gifted’, like the previous rooms did. Simultaneously, I wondered if these could be entryways into the Feywilds, or if they were one-directional …<br>But their distinct shade of violet must have reflected the school of conjuration, implying ( to my mind ) unidirectionality – in hindsight, at least.<br>Thaddeus and Lady Liatris try to speak to them in any language they know; anything with any roots in Fey tongues. Lady Liatris’ <a data-href=\"Sylvan\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/sylvan.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvan</a> gets their attention, unsurprisingly. That was about as constructive as it got, because she soon started to attack them again.<br>I ran out of energy to heal her before long, and she fell. Corvaux and Grunk stabilised her, fortunately, but I can't help but wonder about the necessity of her chosen course of action. I simply don't see it.<br>I stepped forth to take her place in engaging with the Secret Keeper, in any case, after seeing Thaddeus gift the other a piece of amethyst. I recall thinking that ‘Clever Hands Hold Fast’ might signify that the Secret Keeper, reaching out as it was, might simply have wanted its hand held. Idiotic. By the gods, don't know what came over me to think such a thing.<br>I can't remember what happened next. The first thing I do recall, is that the next moment, I was in agony. I was ( and am ) missing the first two knuckles of my left forefinger, its remaining stump bleeding and hurting. Somehow, I seem to at least have had the sense not to offer up my dominant hand.<br>The next thing I noticed, between the white-hot flashes of pain, is Lady Liatris, passed out on the floor, vanishing — or fading away, in some sense. She just disappeared. In my peripheral vision, I saw the dragon light up in a warm tone.

This new room, too, held a statue – albeit a rather eroded one – with another riddle:<br>\nTest of Trust, Strong Hands Muster. Path Laid Plain, Harm Brings Pain\n<br>There was also a chalk design on the floor, vaguely reminiscent of one of <a data-href=\"Tornwing Haven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Tornwing Haven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tornwing Haven</a>'s meditative walking paths my peers from the <a data-href=\"Circle of Seven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Circle of Seven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle of Seven</a> would traverse when posed with a particularly stubborn disease, cure or other ailment. The challenge in the adjacent space, however, had nothing to do with healing.<br>It felt like a dark pocket realm of some sort. There was an oval-shaped ring made of what seemed to be obsidian, decorated with more designs in all sorts of colours with orbs at their centres, and broken train tracks across the gap in the middle of the ring. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a> took lead, and after his initial examination, we all joined up, gathering the orbs along the way and slotting them into this statue's staff – to no immediate effect, but … what else could be the purpose of such a perfect fit?<br>On the statue's headband, we read: <br>\nwalk beside me, you who brave the path. <br>It was as clear an indicator we were meant to push the statue across the tracks, including the gap about halfway through, and so we did, all four of us.<br>Along the way, three motes of lightning materialised out of nowhere — I think they were playing with us, in a way. Thaddeus managed to shepherd most of them away at length, and apart from getting exposed to a few zaps, we reached the terminal of the tracks safely, upon which the statue, the orbs and the lightning all simply vanished.<br>Lo and behold: the statue in the first room appeared as new upon our return! Now, it's time we rest – we've been on our feet for too long already.<br>Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>Our day started with yet another flight of stairs that needed traversing, followed by one more chamber with a statue. This one, a figure folded into themself with wings wrapped about them, revealed no riddle; it only evoked a keen sense of melancholy. I got the impression this would have to do with the trial ahead, and so we all set out into the adjacent space.<br>It took us outside, in a sense, into a husk of a campsite. The fireplace was dishevelled, broken items lay strewn about, and the tent was hardly worthy of its name. Inside it, we found an ailing person — hypothermic. Given that everything around her, including her bedroll, was wet, that was no surprise.<br>Foolishly, I did not think to offer the amulet <a data-href=\"Vigil\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vigil\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vigil</a> gave me. It's kept me warm on so many cold nights, I might as well have fused with it at this point. Bygones and all that …<br>To keep a long story short: we fixed things around camp, decorated a makeshift grave or tribute to a deceased loved one, and provided the sleeping person with renewed shelter, food and warmth.<br>(Though, I will admit to finding the contents of that grave – of sorts – will stick with me. The string about the pouch of contents I found in it was capped off with a hexagonal coin that read ‘Remember all things live. Remember all things die.’)<br>Upon sensing we had helped the person in question, we moved back into the other chamber. The statue had changed – it almost seemed a different statue entirely: open, content, and bearing gifts! I was given a cleansing stone. (I love stones!)<br>With our new items, we return to the room that started this particular branch of the journey – the one with the statues and the fountain. Its door had finally opened to us, and the room it revealed was ( and is ) nothing short of astonishing. A massive tree stands at its centre, its branches seemingly iron with silvery leaves. There’s all manner of items around the periphery of the room, too – a massive crystal, a compass, so many scrolls, books, and more than I can describe.

So: we spoke to <a data-href=\"Caspian\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/library-of-unseen-horizons/caspian.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Caspian</a>, the one responsible for the upkeep and, I suppose, protection of the archive in <a data-href=\"Hystaa's Tower\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Hystaa's Tower\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hystaa's Tower</a>. We discussed the dragon <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> and I saw — and apparently, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a> and <a data-href=\"Lady Liatris\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Liatris\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Liatris</a> did, too, about three weeks prior to our encounter, quite a ways from here, by the <a data-href=\"Halls of Ancestry\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Halls of Ancestry\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Halls of Ancestry</a> up … north, I believe? I should confirm with Thaddeus or Lady Liatris sooner rather than later.<br>Our talks again yielded these images across the walls; like whatever we shared in conversation would have its visual counterpart projected onto the structures. It was an incredible watch.<br>At one point, the note that fell from one of the buildings that the dragon was hauling with him, was revealed to be millennia old — from a time where astral wyrms invaded the material plane, leaving glitches in the fabric of reality at their points of entry.<br>Hardly any sooner in this overwhelming flurry of revelations, Caspian revealed a framed painting of what turned out to be the Halls of Ancestry in the <a data-href=\"Basalt Caverns\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Basalt Caverns\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Basalt Caverns</a> of my home plane. That area was far away from <a data-href=\"Sandfall City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandfall City</a>, nearer the border of the <a data-href=\"Fire Plane\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fire Plane\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fire Plane</a>, and burrowed deep underground. I've only heard of it, unfortunately.<br>Alongside the Basalt Caverns, three other areas host ( apparently less ‘famous’ ) Halls of Ancestry:<br>\n<br>one floats the astral sea, to be found via astral projection (think about it long enough and you’ll get there), and the lair of a solar dragon, apparently;\n<br>one in the the <a data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Feywild</a>;\n<br>and one on <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>, which was in south <a data-href=\"Sylvari\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/sylvari/sylvari.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvari</a>, but has since moved to <a data-href=\"Baheera\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Baheera</a>.\n<br>Caspian revealed these Halls are shrines to the draconic parents and five dragon spirits, as well as a way of preserving draconic history — feats, battles, blood lines, et cetera, as well as records of those that have done or would do grievous harm to dragons.<br>Thaddeus revealed that this dragon they sighted at the Halls of Ancestry (formerly in Sylvari) was called ‘The Old One’? It might have been a protector of that site and decided to leave – with half the construction in tow?! – upon being besieged by thieves and other such rotten folk. At least, that's what I managed to cobble together while listening to Thaddeus’ explanation.<br>Corvaux and I also asked about the yellow dust we found near <a data-href=\"Tornwing Haven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Tornwing Haven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tornwing Haven</a> and all that entailed. Caspian tells us about the <a data-href=\"Pale Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Pale Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pale Blight</a>, named by a myconid of the autumn court in the Feywild. <a data-href=\"Juniper\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Juniper\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Juniper</a>. It was brought to the forest of the <a data-href=\"Silver Maple\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Silver Maple\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silver Maple</a> deliberately; fissures in the fabric of reality led to the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a>, where the blight bled through, and demons, too, would enter this plane through.<br>Once the archfey ruling over the forest had been deliberately crippled by her enemy, she sealed off her forest from within to prevent the spread of the Blight. It stayed sealed for 20 years – until a group of heroes from the Feywild began to decipher what had happened, including Juniper, apparently … could this be how it wound up so close to Tornwing Haven? Where else might it have since spread?<br>I shared with Caspian that we detected the blight by Tornwing Haven, for posterity’s sake. Corvaux shared the recipe for the antidote, in return for which the recipe from the <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> Court shows up on the wall behind Caspian. They tell us they’ll be in touch if they find any new information about the Blight.<br>Before we departed the library at last, Caspian tells us the hexagonal token works as a sending stone of sorts, and that the tokens’ capacities will expand over time. Something to keep an eye on! <br>Upon returning to the first chamber of the tower, we found Lady Liatris again. She was different than how I remembered her — folded into herself, as if in some sort of shock. Humbled, even. Once we asserted she was well enough to travel and willing to come with us, we set out. I'll spare any future finders of this diary the details, so in short: we decided to set out for the ruins straight away to stay ahead of the approaching storm.<br>Upon arrival at the ruins after a ( fortunately! ) fairly uneventful trek, Lady Liatris opened herself up to us to a surprising extent, apologising for any offence she may have caused. It was a brief heart-to-heart in the end, but I was grateful to have been included in it. To cap the conversation off, she even gave each of us a scale off her own tail — a gesture I expect is more significant amongst her kind than I could really know.<br>We set off as a group after that, towards the hole. I ( unsurprisingly ) got sidetracked by a dancing figure. It seems a ritual, like she's casting magic – transmutation, as it turned out. The structure of the statue she was circling around shifted with every touch. After I try to strike up a conversation with her to ask about it, a nearby worker revealed that she won't tell me what her ritual – I presume – is about; she's faithful to the <a data-href=\"Tides of Silence\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Tides of Silence\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tides of Silence</a>, a group of mystics interested in the deep dragon (some type of water dragon?), which I assume means she took an oath of silence? <br>With my curiosity somewhat sated, I joined the rest and we ventured down the hole via the platform (safer that way, especially for Corvaux after she took two falls trying to climb out of the tower just hours prior …). The air was ( and is ) different, cold and humid; the darkness is too ominous for my liking. <br>There's all manner of things to see in the chamber we just wound up in. A statue of Tiamat, a passage with sand dunes layered about it, stairs leading farther down, a huge archways, and a subterranean lake … Now, off to explore all these areas!","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 5","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 5"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/npcs/library-of-unseen-horizons/caspian.html","Hystaa's Tower","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","Thaddeus Quill","Lady Liatris","Halls of Ancestry","Basalt Caverns","locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html","Fire Plane","locations/feywild/feywild.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/sylvari/sylvari.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html","Tornwing Haven","Pale Blight","Juniper","Silver Maple","locations/abyss/abyss.html","locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html","Tides of Silence"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-5.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707155732000,"modifiedTime":1716330284601,"sourceSize":5975,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 5.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-5.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-6.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 6","icon":"","description":"<br>[Session 6] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>This cavern is a maze of things to explore, truly.

Upon entering, I was cast into a dream I had as a child, before <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Malachai\" data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Stonecutter</a> left. It was rather a bizarre dream, but one that shook me to my core and left me weeping in my bed at the time. I dreamt of the Stonecutter's death – or, rather, finding out about it. My juvenile self found him in a bed outside, having passed all alone, nursing the same stone I have embedded in my chest. Perhaps it was a warning of some sort – of whom I would lose and just how fast, at that.<br>I awoke from that moment that couldn't truly have lasted more than a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime spent in that liminal space between the past and the present; conscious and subconscious. As I opened my eyes, I found we were all not in that small building we entered; not really. It turned out we found the shoreline of the <a data-href=\"Astral Sea\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Astral Sea\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Astral Sea</a>, for lack of a better word.<br>Convictions and willpower rule supreme here. Priestess Xandri displayed as much by floating off of the cliff we wound up on. She suggested that dream and my new understanding of it might have been <a data-href=\"Aesa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/aesa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aesa</a> (Weaver of Dreams) reaching out, in a sense — and most importantly, that I should likely decide on whether to chase more dreams and therefore insight before I sleep next.<br>I had more questions I would've asked (what would opening myself up as such entail, for instance?), if not for the thunderous noise that summoned us back to the main cavern. Another note to myself, then: Find Xandri later …<br>Upon return to our realm, we found <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a> had managed to open the gate another passage or area. With our ragtag group reunited, we all set out to explore this new discovery, and land ourselves in a chamber fringed with enormous amethysts, their cores pulsing with various colours. I almost felt like home …<br>We came upon a large, hexagonal structure at the centre, surrounded by several piles of stone. After some trial and error (involving testing the order and orientation of the stone slabs, and reading characters suspended in the amethysts themselves), we managed to unlock a tune of some sort.<br>Upon mimicking it, the doors leading into the hexagon opened, and we were immediately greeted by a corpse. Lovely! Gods, moments like these make me miss life back in <a data-href=\"Tornwing Haven\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Tornwing Haven\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tornwing Haven</a> … but I digress.<br>This is where things got interesting. Lady Liatris and Thaddeus recognised the corpse – or their attire, I suppose? Either way: I, too, recognised the mask belonging to the corpse. I spoke to them of my adventure with <a data-href=\"Bell\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Bell\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Bell</a> years ago, back along the peaks of the <a data-href=\"Nordthorn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordthorn</a> mountain range; about how we sought shelter from a storm in a cavern, found a pair of bumbling cultists attempting a summoning of some sorts, and even the detail about the ten foot door Bell dropped on them.<br>I revealed one of the masks I found on the corpses, briefly touched upon the tattoo on one of the cultists’ neck (that sun with the empty core), and the draconic script found along the door in the cavern wall, and what I recall of it from the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sandfall City\" data-href=\"Sandfall City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandfall</a> temple dedicated to one of the first dragons.<br>( Now that I've looked back on my old entries, I also recall Bell said he was from an area close to a ‘cursed forest’ … Could that be the forest that was sealed off to contain the <a data-href=\"Pale Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Pale Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pale Blight</a>?

It seemed the dragon-esque statue in the centre of the room might've been meant as the object of an experiment involving giving life to stone ..? <br>I hope we can come back to figure it out, alongside the contents of the other panels, because before I knew it, ever enthusiastic Thaddeus set off and we all felt compelled to follow suit.

Not too surprising, then, that I wound up in a very neatly-kept … crypt of sorts, after opening it.<br>The scent of incense, quite like the type used in elven funerals, hung suspended in the air, and a large window afforded a view of massive amethyst formations outside, framed by utter darkness.<br>The room itself contained four sarcophagi, each adorned with different symbols and decorations. A discussion with Professor Hakani has me wondering if these might be disciples of four of the five great dragons – excluding <a data-href=\"Aesa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/aesa.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aesa</a>, as some of her most ‘advanced’ followers do not die, per se; not as we know it. They transcend this way of living and may not die at all in this plane.<br>After a while of pondering and swapping ideas with the professor, I hear voices coming through another door in the chamber. I proceed through it, and find <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> chatting with a stranger in a laboratory of sorts, accompanied by another dragon-like creature.<br>The stranger, named <a data-href=\"Xilo\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Xilo\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Xilo</a>, mentions the four buried in the previous chamber are ‘the ones that came with the books’. What books? Why? I couldn't tell you, dear reader. I'll have to ask later and document what I learn.<br>We all conversed a bit – though I took on more of a listening role than anything else. Corvaux handed over the paper that fell from the building the dragon carried overhead before we set off into Baheera, and apparently this was part of some long-lost book; Xilo also mentioned something about the <a data-href=\"Firmament\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Firmament\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Firmament</a> ( disciples of <a data-href=\"Gereth\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/gereth.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Gereth</a> ), and then the conversation veered towards a blood sigil Thaddeus and Corvaux found.<br>When the two set off in its direction again, I followed along — not expecting to be of much help, really, but you never know, right?

We had won, but just barely. After picking up our unconscious allies, we retreated to the living quarters to recover over a meal prepared by our host, <a data-href=\"Xilo\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Xilo\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Xilo</a>.<br>Over the meal, we satisfied our curiosity about each other's pasts and the like. Corvaux revealed her Shadar Kai heritage for the first time upon being … confronted, perhaps, about the dark, powdery substance substituting for blood in her body. Quite normal and not at all alarming, apparently.<br>We also took a less-hurried look at Thaddeus’ forearm, revealing what had up until now remained hidden beneath his sleeves. Obsidian formations there now lay surrounded with magical veins of swirling oranges, reds and yellows, resembling lava flows. It brought to mind fire genasi and even magma para-genasi — some elemental force must be at play here. Corvaux did mention that given our presence in a place of dragon worship, perhaps it was one of the five dragon spirits. <a data-href=\"Pyra\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pyra</a>, maybe?

Upon inspection, I recognised protective runes etched into the grand arches of <a data-href=\"Straterra University\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Straterra University\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Straterra University</a> back home in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sandfall City\" data-href=\"Sandfall City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandfall</a>. In that particular case, they supplemented <a data-href=\"Lady Sunnis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Sunnis\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Sunnis</a>' protection, meant specifically to off-set any seismic and sonic damage before it can occur.<br>Nightbloom perused the text in kind, at one point even humming a few harmonic notes. She revealed the notation system was some kind of astral musical script used to record the language, which is actually sung and whistled. Thaddeus seemed quite fascinated — which is only fair, given that his fate has been tied to whatever resides in that amulet. All I know is that the entity is called <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" data-href=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Zirel</a>.<br>I left Thaddeus and Nightbloom to their work, throwing myself back onto the translation of my father’s diary. Corvaux and Lady Liatris were already off to an adjacent chamber to work on learning how to handle a dagger (with Corvaux being the obvious teacher). This left me to pore over the infernal texts alone, which, to no one’s surprise, yielded me absolutely no new insights.<br>Once we’d all rested up and filled our bellies, we returned to the blood sigil in the library. We knew that, if fed the sacrifice of a soul, it would open a portal to the abyss. The more often the portal opened, the more stable it would become until remaining permanently open after enough activations.<br>We also knew it could be destroyed by holy water, but had none available to us. Before we could plan our next move to find some, or seek an alternative cleansing method, Lady Liatris seemed compelled to offer her draconic blood, gripped by an urge from the dagger – gifted by <a data-href=\"Tiamat\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/tiamat.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tiamat</a>? – she obtained. Though we pleaded for her to stop, she proceeded as intended all the same. Her reckless gambit left her drained white as a ghost, and her blood was swallowed by the sigil ( to no further horrendous effect, fortunately ). In frustrated rage, Corvaux stormed off.<br>We then scrambled to collect all sharp objects as her body drained of colour, hoping to avoid any more \"accidents\" that might continue fuelling this evil portal.<br>Hardly any sooner than that, Corvaux's cry of \"Emergency at the stairs!\" rang out from the stairwell …","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 8","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 8"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["images/creatures/summoned_demon.png","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","entities/npcs/dig-team/professor-ssimmia-hakani.html","Tallie","Lady Liatris","Xilo","entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html","Thaddeus Quill","Straterra University","locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html","Lady Sunnis","Thousand-Eyed Deceiver","entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/tiamat.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-8.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707157391000,"modifiedTime":1716330822475,"sourceSize":4306,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 8.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-8.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-9.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 9","icon":"","description":"<br>Session 9 Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>As <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Eldanor Nightbloom\" data-href=\"Eldanor Nightbloom\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/eldanor-nightbloom.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nightbloom</a>, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a> and I caught up to the others, <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>'s dire warning continued echoing through the stairwell – we were all to be careful not to fall in battle, lest our corpses be dragged down to feed the sigil below.<br>Emerging upstairs, we found ourselves in the chamber full of amethyst and those … ‘singing stones’ again, the space now fully illuminated.

Upon diving in, I found a stone door that slid into the wall, the mechanism of which had been damaged by some force, providing me with an entryway. Beside a few scattered fragments of a boat and some cloth, an illuminated rune came into sight. A stone arch, untouched by harm, guarded another door.

Anur fearlessly went ahead to investigate and eventually led us to discover two sprites (pixies? nixies?). and a messenger bag with some items inside – including some expensive wine, apparently.

Not even Da’yin was left unaffected by it.<br>The main takeaways: the source of Ted’s trouble is Obyrith, an eldritch race of demons, older than even most of the gods.

If he is pure enough of heart, he should be accepted, and come out of it being his truest self.<br>Lastly, on a more personal note, she advised me to lie to some extent ( apparently, it's dangerous to be so honest ), and to be cautious with my words; even a lie, if told often enough, will become true when spoken in the Feywilds. I left with the promise to return when I have news and make more of a habit out of it. I will not wait another three decades to return, at least.<br>Upon coming to, I felt different — something in me had changed… My purpose has shifted, my horizons broadened. I am unsure of the implications, but somehow I seem to feel all the more strongly about what happened once I got out of my hut.<br>As the morning unfolds, Ted sits secluded, holding tightly onto a scroll and a knife, while <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Runa\" data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Anur</a> returns from a hunt, presenting a great deer to the camp — clearly successful in her pursuits of the wild game. I felt a bit dishevelled myself, ruminating on the night's encounter with Da'yin, searching for the right words to share with the group.<br>Ted before long revealed that overnight, he negotiated with a devil named <a data-href=\"Epiphany\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Epiphany</a> from the infernal realm of <a data-href=\"Malbolge\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malbolge\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malbolge</a>, a prison realm of sorts. His deal allegedly involves gathering three remarkable souls for this devil, using a new ring as a tool. The deal should release him from <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" data-href=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Zirel</a>'s grasp. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mirri\" data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirabelle</a> listens intently, cautioning him against following too closely in the wayward footsteps of <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>. <br>I, meanwhile, worry whether this demon will even have the power to undo a pact with something that is more than a mere demon as we know them, per Da'yin's explanation. Ted could not be swayed, however … I suppose all we can do ( now that Ted has left us ) is keep an ear to the ground to hear of any transgressions past the deal he agreed to — and simply hope he will find his precious souls in those who have earned such a … shitty ending.<br>ior.

I will admit: I was viscerally uncomfortable, and think I spent the majority of the ensuing time either sweating or shivering. <br>Gifts of narration and song were offered, and Anur even surprised us all with her skill on the lyre. With these gifts presented, the pixies departed — but I fear I'll have repercussions to deal with in return for my lack of preparation. I was told, in a whisper I wish to forget as fast as I can, to not \"trip on my words next time\", before they vanished. My anxiety swelled to the point where I openly sought the comfort of a held hand, wary beyond any measure I've ever felt before.

The issue of the pack persisted, though; <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Runa\" data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Anur</a>'s desire to delve into it weighed against <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mirri\" data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirabelle</a>'s insistence on understanding the hunter's narrative.<br>Anur's intent on entering the pack led to a collective decision; ensuring its security demanded creativity. The choice to pursue an animal guardian fell to Jorinn, who returned with an almiraj named <a data-href=\"Phlip\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Phlip\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Phlip</a>, while I closed the entrance to the cave after patching up Anur (likewise alongside Jorinn). <br>We were prepared to enter whatever lay in the pack stealthily. Anur, in her guise as a fallen enemy, led us in — upon which all of us, save for Anur, were caged upon entering. Her quest for tokens to authorise our release sent her away, leaving us encased and uncertain.<br>The prison's bars were eerily reminiscent of the cold iron found in the <a data-href=\"Bitter Steppes\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Bitter Steppes\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitter Steppes</a> at home, including their anti-magical properties. All we could do as such was wait in lieu of risking a botched attempt at escaping and triggering more alarms ( or worse ), until Anur returned with the means to unshackle us: tokens bearing <a data-href=\"Asmodeus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Asmodeus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Asmodeus</a>' seal, striking deeper questions about our actual location.<br>My best guess to this point is that we're in a demi-plane of some sort. I suspected the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a> for a moment, but the sigil anchoring the portal in place simply didn't seem to suggest it. All the same time, knowing the symbol on this seal has everything to do with Asmodeus, still raises questions. This place is called “<a data-href=\"Dain's Prison\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Dain's Prison\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Dain's Prison</a>” – and by virtue of our last talk with Ted, I recall <a data-href=\"Glasya\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Glasya\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Glasya</a>, Asmodeus’ daughter, rules the prison plane of the hells (<a data-href=\"Malbolge\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malbolge\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malbolge</a>). What if this “Dain's Prison” is somehow connected to it? Related to it? It is the only way in which the symbols on these tokens make any sense to me.<br>Ah, I digress. We ventured further after a moment, down the stairs, and were greeted by braziers that seemed to conceal more prisons. Lining the walls, tables held both scholarly scrolls and unsettling dissection instruments. Amidst a cold emanating glow, Jorinn's and my attempt to obtain a shard from a peculiar crystal teetered between curiosity and caution—the material's fragility and volatility reminiscent of volatile cold iron.<br>The others already ventured farther down the stairs.

Wisp confirmed it was related to the star she could hear, and, since the <a data-href=\"Crimson Gaze\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Crimson Gaze</a> is departing in two days, asked if I could trace the sound to its source before then—two days! How am I to even do that? It lingers as an unsettling challenge even now—cross-planar communication holds a sliver of uncertainty, after all, and I don’t expect the Crimson Gaze to hang around in the <a data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Feywild</a> after departing.<br>The next morning, I got to wondering whether something's wrong with <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>—not in the offensive sense, but she's been sleeping; dreaming, even, instead of going into a trance. I wonder to what end she's doing that, but I haven't the heart to pry.<br>Instead, I asked <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> not to indulge further in theft while she pored through a massive tome, urging some respect toward Deidre's home. Yet as words faltered, I found Mirri unmoved—and, somewhat comically, the egg she pilfered missing from her possession. I got the impression she blamed me for it …<br>Oh, well. Maybe <a data-href=\"Grout\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Grout\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grout</a> or <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> got their sticky little paws on it. In any case, Corvaux and I headed off to prepare tea for the group atop glowing coals, which is when we stumbled upon symbols amongst the wood—a death's-head moth and a rough diamond, the latter which was especially familiar to me as a symbol of <a data-href=\"Dounuma\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/dounuma.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Dounuma</a>'s (or Dumathoin, if you will). A conversation with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Deidre\" data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> about such ominous icons is due at some point, but we had more pressing matters to resolve, first.<br>Together, Corvaux and I sought Deidre, where I clumsily offered tea, only to witness it discarded with nonchalance—an embarrassing testament to our different tastes, I suppose. We apologised for Mirri's pilfering. In retrospect, I'm relieved she wasn't there to hear it. I fear she'd have struck us both upside the head with a well-aimed Eldritch Blast in retaliation for speaking on her behalf.<br>Before long, our ensemble convened to devise a plan. The vault beneath the manor most likely contained the heart of the curse. Deidre recounted a symbol to beware of—a symbol eerily familiar the several I've found in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Malachai\" data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Stonecutter</a>'s journal.<br>decided to reveal the contents of the journal to the group—not just one person; not just to Corvaux as I did before, but everyone. The depth of the Stonecutter's work startled both Mirri and me with its potency, detailing entities known for pilfering souls, evoking the name of the dreaded <a data-href=\"Orcus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Orcus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Orcus</a>, and a record narrating an inquiry into the lineage and purpose of missing souls. The symbols somehow seemed to depict anchors of such souls, in a sense?<br>Mirri stressed the power described in just these few pages, warning that it must never fall into <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tlanbourn</a>'s hands. In fact, she would sooner set the journal and myself on fire than let that happen. She would have to; my resolve to hang onto these wretched pages and follow them to my destination is stronger now than ever before. I'll not give this up willingly.<br>Based on these findings, though, I theorized the circular symbols Deidre sketched out might just be what's anchoring her here—her soul, specifically. Depending on the exact state of the symbol, we might need to destroy it, or dismantle it by tampering with the Weave that powers it. It'll be tricky nonetheless, I expect.<br>So we traversed to the basement, Ralph and Grout left above to avoid harm. We found the entry sealed, but with Corvaux's touch, the stone slid away, revealing the steps into depths gilded as solid gold. Below, statues and a white bowl before a lit effigy of Lord <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Eristalon\" data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aurelius</a> (or Eristalon, as we've come to know the name) beckoned for an offering. Deidre's wooden wolf idol granted us passage. <br>In the next chamber, a grand harp stood amid silence, and we discovered a sigil requiring a key—the solution lay within a treasury that awoke armoured assailants as Corvaux and Mirri crossed its threshold. After a scuffle, we claimed the gold and gems inside, aquamarine crystals particularly catching my eye—a near sacred piece of my homeland.<br>Mirri's critique of my fascination with the gems sparked bitterness; I felt the chasm my earlier request might have given way to, widen. Nonetheless, we affirmed the spoils were not Deidre's to start with (so I assume they belonged to this Eristalon), and divided them fairly amongst all of us. In hindsight, I wonder what might become of us if he ever finds out what we took from his treasury …<br>With this chamber practically emptied, a secret chamber revealed itself, one that turned our stomachs with decay and one that encompassed something other than golden, shiny wealth—organs, daggers, and the lingering questions that now we must still answer.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 26","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 26"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html","entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html","locations/feywild/feywild.html","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","Grout","entities/animal-companions/ralph.html","entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/dounuma.html","entities/player-characters/deidre.html","Malachai","Orcus","Vestan Tlanbourn","Eristalon"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-26.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1712678746000,"modifiedTime":1717084928227,"sourceSize":5071,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 26.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-26.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-27.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 27","icon":"","description":"<br> Day 29 of Bloomweave, 515 T.A.?<br>\nToday's explorations in the manor's depths proved both wondrous and unsettling.

Another crown similarly held promise of some magic potency—something that would turn \"if looks could kill\" into reality, I believe?<br>I admittedly found myself somewhat distracted during the explanation, for amidst the gems on the centre table was a piece of amber, flawlessly cut, with a small acorn suspended inside, glowing with a golden aura. Corvaux handed it to me, and I was transported back to my journey to <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>, to a tale an old man spun about <a data-href=\"Silvanus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/silvanus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silvanus</a>.<br>Deep in a forest far to the south-west of Rakāuvi, lies a tree where Silvanus slumbers. When he stirs, roused by anger, the tree drops golden acorns imbued with the power to cheat death itself. A seed of resurrection, forever tied to his resting place. We agreed to safeguard this treasure, should dire need arise—even if death, indeed, is a natural part of life. I won't have us lightly use such an item as such.<br>My attention then turned to a tome sealed within a blue dome—the Dendritic Grimorium. Its pages no doubt held forbidden secrets of controlling plants and forging unnatural connections, echoing <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a>' interest in the murals about bringing stone to life; turning it sentient. When I queried Mirri about her own research, her curt dismissal left me bristling. Her apparent bitterness hung like a shroud I could not pierce.<br>As we paused near the coffins, an unseen force intervened. From my pack tumbled a glass eye, its gaze fixed unerringly upon me. Panic gripped my heart—it seems a hag named <a data-href=\"Sabina\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Sabina\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sabina</a>, spurned by Deidre, is now watching my every step. This must be those scratched out pixies’ doing. Oh, I do so treasure the variety of life—but I will be the first to admit there is no love lost between myself and them. Either way, I hastily buried the eye deep in my belongings, where it must have spent the past few days, praying it would bring no further misfortune to my companions until we have a moment to address the matter properly.<br>We had a task to complete first, after all. We returned to the locked door in the first chamber, which after some trial and error, Corvaux managed to unlock, permitting us to pass farther below ground. Here, we encountered a sprawling sigil scrawled in myriad tongues—<a data-href=\"Abyssal\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/abyssal.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyssal</a>, <a data-href=\"Druidic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Druidic\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Druidic</a>, <a data-href=\"Sylvan\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/sylvan.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvan</a>. Mirri understood the grand majority of what was written there; I needed only pitch in to help her decipher the Druidic, which seemed … strangely off-beat.<br>Her sudden demand for privacy between herself and Deidre caught me off guard. Reluctantly, I followed Corvaux and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>, my heart heavy with worry for Deidre and frustration at my own impotence.<br>Relief washed over me when they both returned, seemingly unharmed, with Deidre proclaiming her newfound freedom. But a new mission called—the remains of <a data-href=\"Kai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Kai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Kai</a>, her ghostly friend, awaited recovery.<br>A small jaunt later, we found ourselves in what felt like catacombs of sorts—the walls set with bones, skeletons suspended from chains, and coffins smattered about an off-shoot of the main chamber. Urgency seized Corvaux as she plunged into the well at the centre before long … with <a data-href=\"the Stonecutter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/the Stonecutter\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Stonecutter</a>'s journal in her pack.

A small canoe bobbed beyond the entangled roots, while sated redcap mushrooms dotted the surroundings, their thirst for blood temporarily quenched by <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>'s apparent intervention before we even got down here.<br><a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> and I illuminated our path with a torch, and soon, she uncovered <a data-href=\"Kai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Kai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Kai</a>'s skeletal remains. As we all mused over Elven funerary rites, Deidre and Corvaux delicately retrieved the bones from the watery graves. With the skull in hand, Kai faded from view, exhaustion claiming his ethereal form.<br>Amidst the depths, the star's melody swelled, a symphony of wind and <a data-href=\"draconic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/draconic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">draconic</a> phrases intertwined with an unfamiliar tongue. With some concentration, the others could hear it, too, to varying extents. Its theme was centred around “creation”, “celebration”, “awakening” … Somehow, perhaps because of this slow recognition, the sound became less eerie, and more so alien.<br>As we ventured towards the boat, a peculiar figure emerged from the shadows—a myconid, its mushroom cap crowning layered robes. <a data-href=\"Chip\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Chip\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Chip</a>, this new acquaintance of ours from the<a data-href=\"Blight Commune\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Blight Commune\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Blight Commune</a>, extended an invitation to their domain, but first, some of us – mainly <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a> and I, with Deidre choosing to accompany us – needed to return to the surface to gather <a data-href=\"Grout\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Grout\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grout</a>, <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> and possessions.<br>During our ascent – unfortunately at the cost of Corvaux plunging into the water once the Flight spell was cast on me … –, I offered to carry Luck and Deidre. Luck was easy enough to carry, and Deidre helped carry her weight by … well, clinging to me like a monkey of sorts. All very cute, and I admit I quite appreciated the embrace, though that appreciation turned to me being flustered as her fingers found my hair. It was a gentle, rather unfamiliar touch that set my cheeks ablaze. Her whispered praise only deepened the hue, and I found myself grateful for the fact she was holding onto my back and not my front, obscuring my flustered reaction.<br>‘Listen’ carefully, whoever might read this (shame on you for snooping!): it is not like I don't know how to accept affections, or even solicit them. She simply caught me unprepared. Anyway …<br>Reunited with Grout, Ralph, and our belongings, we descended once more below ground, the star's song resuming its ethereal refrain. But before we could decipher its meaning, <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> called us to attention, her demeanour tense.<br>She spoke of <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>, the Elven sorcerer she'd hunted across planes for over half a century. His vile ambitions to tear asunder the fabric of reality and beckon forth the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a> had left a trail of destruction, the recent carnage on a <a data-href=\"Sylvari\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/sylvari/sylvari.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvari</a> farm a grim testament to his cruelty. Only young <a data-href=\"Nettie\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Nettie\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nettie</a> had survived, shielded by a nearby shrine's grace. <br>Well, Nettie, and <a data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malachai</a>—or the Scribe, as the cultists apparently called him, and the Stonecutter in most of my entries so far. It was apparently he who had painted the walls with bloody scripture, opening the rift into what must have been the 108th layer of <a data-href=\"hell\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/hell\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">hell</a>—or an attempt at it. I don't actually know if that rift led to its intended destination, and at that point, I didn't bother to ask.<br>This moment felt pivotal, for we were ( and are ) close to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" data-href=\"Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fallen Halls</a> where we hope to find Vestan. Now that the explicit ties between Vestan and Malachai were made clear, or the purpose the latter served to the former, I felt it was no longer appropriate for me to hold back the truth—especially not as the others seemed to grow progressively more suspicious of the trouble I had hiding my reactions to every mention of Malachai's name.<br>As the truth regarding who he was – or is – to me spilled forth ( my father ), Mirri's face drained of color. Fear, and something more inscrutable, contorted her features. She reveals she fears leading us to our doom—and perhaps me in particular, a genasi who always strived to attain Malachai's level of skill with stone and crystal. With Malachai having escaped Vestan with Mirri's and <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a>'s help, what if I’m considered the next best option?<br>Or worse: what if my mother is? Malachai did say he had no time to spare; that he had to protect his family. Unless he has other children I am unaware of … I must return home, and fast—the second this mess here has been resolved. I won't trust his word for it if he tells my mother is safe—or even if he tells me the opposite. I must see for myself … assuming not too much time has passed there, in comparison to the <a data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Feywild</a>.<br>Now all the cards are on the table, at least as far as I can tell, we resolved to spend the last hours of the day seeking out this start – we're so close; I can feel it! – and gather our strength before confronting Tlanbourn. But as the hag's eye lingered in my pack, a reminder of unseen threats, I now can't help but wonder what twisted paths lie ahead, and what price we'll need to pay to see this journey through.

Our towering host, Silo … something something IV, proved to be a kindred spirit in his proclivity for herbal relaxation, but more important than that was his stock beyond the remedies for our collective anxiety. Mirri sought a charm-repelling potion to no avail, so I bartered for vials of holy water, a necessity for a protective spell.

The 108th layer, if my intuition serves me right. A pattern I've grown uncomfortably familiar with. I'd like not to gain more hands-on experience with it than necessary, so I do hope he keeps that bottle firmly sealed.<br>Master Silo spoke of a necrotic frozen lake in need of cleansing, a task for another day. For now, we retired to the <a data-href=\"Slumbering Blossom\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Slumbering Blossom\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Slumbering Blossom</a>, where Mirri opened up about <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>, the mage who's haunted her for 54 years—a span equal to my entire life. She painted a picture of a charming, manipulative caster, his true visage obscured by time and dark deeds.<br>But it was her own tale that struck me to the core. Vestan's ritual, the black ichor, the <a data-href=\"abyssal\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/abyssal.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">abyssal</a> runes drawn onto ( or into ) her skin—a pact made manifest.<br>Mirri's pain was palpable as she recounted how Vestan took <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Paelias\" data-href=\"Paelias\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Paelias\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">her brother'</a>s life, a mere 29 years of age. The weight of her family's scorn, the burden of survival—it all crashed over me like a tidal wave.<br>Perhaps the most chilling revelation to me, personally: her belief that my father, <a data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malachai</a>, might be one of <a data-href=\"Mystra\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/mystra.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mystra</a>'s Children, a mage of unparalleled power born in the wake of the <a data-href=\"Spellplague\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Spellplague\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spellplague</a>'s end.<br>Could he really have been chosen by Mystra herself? Literally?<br>No matter the answer to that question, a promise was due and so I made it—perhaps naive in my optimism, but fuelled by the unshakable faith in our group's strength and its burgeoning cohesion. We will see this through: Mirri's tale will not end in tragedy. Not on my watch.<br>As the night wore on, Mirri, Deidre and I indulged in some Dream Grass to upend the tension for a while, followed by a dose of Druid's Dram for Mirri and I not long after. Luck, meanwhile, succumbed to a potion-induced vision, a flying castle hurtling towards him … I think? Really, at that point, I was rather out of it, too. Mirri and I, lost in the haze of the tincture of sorts, heard the fungus sing, its joyous melody drowning out the star's ethereal refrain for the first time.<br>The giddiness that came with it all is slowly dissipating as I write this.

Or maybe it's three – I need to gather my thoughts about it whenever next I have a spare moment, I believe. In any case ...<br>Last night, as I drifted into the realm between waking and dreaming, I found myself once more in the presence of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\" data-href=\"Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/da'yin-kuya-of-infinite-facets.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Da'yin</a>. Her visage was not as I remembered – its geodesic properties having grown dull, grey almost, and her surroundings bare-bones in comparison to the chambers lined with shelves and books, jars, ingredients … Her home, apparently, lies now in ruins, and three of her siblings were lost to the cruelty of corrupt <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Roshmore Tower\" data-href=\"Roshmore Tower\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Roshmore Tower\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Roshmarian</a> mages. These vile cultists (always the cultists of late …), disciples of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Asmodeus\" data-href=\"Asmodeus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Asmodeus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lord of Lies</a> himself, have a history of enslaving primordials. Da'yin warned me against venturing near <a data-href=\"Umbrosia\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/umbrosia/umbrosia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Umbrosia</a> and the infamous Rashmore Tower.<br>If nothing else, this served as a reminder of the centuries of suffering endured by the dao at the hands of mages, demons, and other malevolent entities. To think I once wondered why they're so secretive, isolated … When I offered my aid, Da'yin's response was measured — unless I possessed knowledge of the Roshmarian mages or a pure source of aether ore, my assistance from afar would be limited.<br>I won't deny still feeling forlorn about the knowledge that I cannot abandon my current quest; not unless expressly bidden to do so, as determined by our agreement. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan</a>'s threat looms too large, threatening the very fabric of existence. With a heavy heart, I conveyed my predicament to Da'yin, who, in her wisdom, did not begrudge me. Instead, she assured me she has handled worse, that she will rebuild — and even imparted a spell that would allow me to detect sources of pure elemental power, a tool to aid in locating imprisoned genies and, perhaps one day, guide me home through elemental vortices.<br>Before our communion drew to a close, I shared the events that had transpired since our last encounter. I spoke of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thaddeus Quill\" data-href=\"Thaddeus Quill\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thaddeus Quill\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaddeus</a>' fateful deal, the coming and going of companions, and the looming shadow of Vestan Tlanbourn. But it was the star I'm pursuing that captivated Da'yin — a beacon of pure Primordial energy, a cosmic lynchpin. She spoke of legends, of the \"<a data-href=\"Forge of Apotheosis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Forge of Apotheosis\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Forge of Apotheosis</a>” some of these stars were captured to fuel … This legend is unknown to me, but something tells me I'll learn the truth of it soon enough.<br>Naturally, I couldn't leave without mentioning the hag's eye, described by some Fey, apparently, as a ‘fell curse’. Da'yin warned me said curse would only grow in power with time, and advised encasing it in lead for now, or even feeding it to some insatiable creature for now, cautioning against confronting the hag directly. I'm not entirely sure I'll find a creature voracious enough to solve this problem for me, so I must look to alternatives: to convince the hag she holds no sway over me (fat chance, says I), or redirect her gaze elsewhere … A plan hatched then and there: what if I can redirect the hag's malice towards Vestan himself?<br>Of course, the conversation inevitably turned to my parents, to the revelation of my father's entanglement with Vestan's machinations. Fear gripped me—what if Vestan's cultists sought vengeance against him, now that he'd been free? Was he even free, still? Was my <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Özge\" data-href=\"Özge\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Özge\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">mother</a>? Da'yin, in her compassion, offered to have another see if my mother's safe and deliver a message on my behalf; a warning, more like.<br>Once I awoke, the world seemed to shift. <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>, her hands wreathed in inky darkness, climbed through the window, a gelatinous familiar from the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a> in tow. There was hardly any time to ponder this development—a shadow, cold and strange, lunged at Mirri amidst her ritual to identify a demon-possessed bottle.<br>The battle was brief but intense, the shadow speaking in <a data-href=\"Abyssal\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/abyssal.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyssal</a> upon its defeat. Mirri, visibly shaken, revealed it was an old friend, promising to explain when her composure returned. The ritual resumed, unveiling the bottle as road to <a data-href=\"Orcus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Orcus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Orcus</a>' domain, the 333rd layer of the Abyss. So, not the 108th as I suspected, but I suppose that would have been too great a coincidence, wouldn't it?<br>As we discussed how to dispose of this vile artefact, a few ideas took root. The hatred between devils and demons was legendary—perhaps a devil could destroy what we could not. Or, I reasoned as one of several not particularly drawn to the idea of bargaining with a devil (I'll not follow Thaddeus’ example there), I could seek out another portal to the Abyss and cast the bottle into its depths.<br>The hag's eye remained a pressing concern, too. We explored options—encasing it in lead or feeding it to a Xorn or other ravenous creature to buy time. I revealed my interest in slipping it to Vestan himself as a way to trick the hag into surrendering her hold over me.<br>Mirri's revelation about the hag's red hair – per <a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a>'s description, assuming this even is the same hag she's acquainted with! – sparked determination: we would inflict this curse upon Vestan if given the chance. Apparently, redheads are his type …<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>, too, faces a curse of his own — why would he keep clear of curses after just having escaped one the pixies subjected him to? This time, the curse is centred around an axe he took from the chamber with artefacts under Deidre's mansion, jealous and needy, identified by Mirri's magic. He and I at least share a goal: to be rid of the items that seek to make our lives miserable!<br>Gods, we have much to take care of in the coming days … ","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 30","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 30"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/npcs/titans/da'yin-kuya-of-infinite-facets.html","Roshmore Tower","Asmodeus","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/umbrosia/umbrosia.html","Vestan Tlanbourn","Thaddeus Quill","Forge of Apotheosis","Özge","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","locations/abyss/abyss.html","languages/abyssal.html","Orcus","entities/player-characters/deidre.html","entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-30.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1719243239000,"modifiedTime":1719245338000,"sourceSize":5984,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 30.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-30.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-31.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 31","icon":"","description":"<br>Day 30 of Bloomweave, 515 T.A.?<br>Our journey took us first to <a data-href=\"Herbs 'n Legends\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Herbs 'n Legends\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Herbs 'n Legends</a>, where <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Master Silo\" data-href=\"Master Silo\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Master Silo\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silo</a> works.

Silly me, I suppose.<br>Setting out with Silo, we ventured towards the necrotic lake we'd pledged to help him with. The landscape shifted between barren stretches and lush growths, a dichotomy that left me pondering the nature of the <a data-href=\"Underfey\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Underfey\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Underfey</a>. It's not like what I've seen in the <a data-href=\"Earth Plane\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/earth-plane.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Earth Plane</a>, nor in any subterranean dwellings I've visited on <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>. But both places stretch on seemingly endlessly, and I've but seen a few corners of each so far.<br>I was taken out of my idle reminiscing as we approached our destination, for a biting cold seeped into the air, our breaths crystallizing before us.<br>The lake, a frozen expanse, glowed with an eerie light beneath the ice. A colossal oak tree towered above to our left, its heights seemingly infinite. Corvaux, ever the intrepid investigator, scaled the tree, almost disappearing from view. They reported a shifting presence under the ice, an elk skull adorned with vines and golden motes on one of the nearby rocks, and a polished stone of sorts hidden among dried ferns on another.<br>Deidre, levitating towards the lake's heart, found herself sapped of strength by the mysterious light. It became clear that this place was once a shrine, now tainted by an unknown force. Amidst this revelation, I noticed the star's song, my constant companion, had grown muffled — a sign, perhaps, that we were drawing closer to its source.<br>Our investigation led us to a key forged from Cold Iron, languishing at the lake's depths. Its very presence seemed to poison the surroundings, selectively stifling magic and draining everything that came close to it from life. As I touched the ice, memories of the <a data-href=\"Bitter Steppes\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Bitter Steppes\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitter Steppes</a>, the drawings I've seen and the tales I've been told of this perilous boundary between Earth and Water in my home plane, flooded back to me. I might have entertained the thought longer, if not for <a data-href=\"Grout\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Grout\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grout</a>'s sudden yelp — not even he, a frost puppy of all creatures, could stand the bitter cold of the ice! And I understand it all too well; withdrawing my own palm from the ice felt akin to freezing one's tongue to an icicle, and then trying to pull it off without leaving its top layer of skin on the ice!<br>It took a moment, but once I succeeded, <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>'s quick thinking and spell-casting allowed us to retrieve the key, but its handling posed a new dilemma. Cold Iron's properties were not to be trifled with; it's shielding effects towards magic seemed selective to me, and Silo didn't sugarcoat the effects the metal has on Fey creatures — and, I suppose, even those who aren't Fey. Any illness caused by Cold Iron is incurable.<br>Mirri, through her arcane expertise, identified the key as a gateway to a vault of sorts; a door that is only a door when the key is present. With this knowledge, we split our group — Corvaux, Deidre and Mirri remaining with the key while Silo, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>, and I returned to the Blight Commune in search of a leaden case to contain both the key and the hag's eye that haunted me. In our search, we opted for a larger case – 600 gold – to contain Luck's cursed axe as well, once he was able to release it from his grasp, at least. Note to self: check in with others about contributing to the costs of the case — yes, even Luck, despite ( or maybe because ) of his abysmal lack of ability to manage his finances effectively. Good grief, I've never seen anything quite like it! <br>It was in the act of transferring the key to its new container upon our return to the lake, that I was thrust into a vivid, almost tangible vision. My consciousness hurtled through memories not my own, plunging into the vast Jade Sea. I became the jade itself, shattered, collected, and subjected to an agonising cycle of freezing, soaking, drying, hammering and grinding. The pain was unlike any I had ever experienced, and it was only through sheer good fortune and I presume the help of my companions back in the Underfey that I managed to return to myself.<br>It was an unexpected ordeal, but I took comfort in Silo's kindness shining through as he bestowed upon us unlabelled potions and directions (of sorts) to the <a data-href=\"Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fallen Halls of Eristalon</a>. His attempt to remove the curse of the hag's eye, however, yielded mixed results, due to not fault of his. The eye's gaze upon testing whether removing the curse had worked now fell upon Deidre. A dose of guilt and feeling like a failed court jester was precisely what I needed, of course. So, I suppose the plan to either get it to fixate on Vestan or feed it to a xorn remains.<br>For now, with the key hidden away, the star's song regained some of its clarity, though its direction remained elusive. Silo, through the use of Augury, provided a glimmer of guidance—the path ahead would lead me closer to my goal.<br>And so we pressed on, ascending towards the surface once more. We emerged into a glade of breathtaking beauty, soft grasses and lush mosses beneath our feet.

I also recalled tales of settlements and caravans that had suffered the wrath of a Dao, left to stand as stone monuments to the folly of crossing such powerful beings. Yet this felt different, like some other force was at work here.<br>Amidst the grey, we sought a rumoured green presence, the same mystery that had drawn <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>'s three trainees to this eerie place. Our path soon led us to petrified figures; not the trainees, fortunately, but others, frozen in time for a longer time still. One stood apart, hooded and twisted, a hand raised as if caught in the act of casting. The others, clad in identical armour bearing an oak leaf sigil, lay scattered, seemingly felled by a powerful blast.<br><a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a>'s reaction was visceral—recognition and fear intermingled. These were members of a corrupt order from the old <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> Court under <a data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eristalon</a>'s rule, a group she knew all too well. As <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> and Corvaux toppled one of the statues in an act of solidarity, I scanned the shadows, wary of unseen observers. The branches above, shattered like stone, hinted at a struggle of some sort. There was no real way of telling how recent it was, though.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>'s attempt to detect magic yielded nothing, deepening the mystery. How could such widespread petrification occur without a trace of arcane energy? As I pondered this, the star's music, ever-present, began to clarify, almost as if intent on drawing my attention to it. The once garbled phrases took shape, speaking of creation once more, and … cosmic beginnings. Corvaux, too, heard the song—that is, its <a data-href=\"Celestial\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/celestial.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Celestial</a> vein. We theorised that the star might be linked to the gods themselves, its melody a reflection of their influence, or perhaps the star sings of the creation of the constellation whence it came … Again: I have more questions than answers!<br>Our exploration then took us to a ruined castle, its collapse clearly postdating the petrification. The deliberate nature of the destruction, with bricks torn from the floor and scratch marks marring the stone, and Luck's particular investigation, suggested the work of a dragon. Deidre's knowledge of the place proceeded to paint a picture of a secluded base, seemingly used by the Autumn Court authorities to hide secrets from the public eye.<br>The age of the petrification must span a century or more at this point, yet the castle's destruction seemed more recent, with some areas having crumbled mere weeks ago. Not that this knowledge changed much; the recent damage could have been random, rather than the result of a stumbling dragon. <br>We proceeded farther down the corridor and down the hall, revealing a passage at the building's rear. This led us to a courtyard, where the impossible greeted us. Amidst the stone, living oak trees towered, their leaves rustling in defiance of the petrification. Ivy and moss, vibrant and alive, clung to the central building. Luck's magical detection revealed a chilling truth—the mist that enveloped this oasis was steeped in necromancy. Again. I thought it was mostly <a data-href=\"Winter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter</a> that had a penchant for welcoming undead and the like, but I guess I was mistaken.<br>We prepared to brave the cold with that cold iron key in tow, dark magic permeating an adjacent chamber, but caution tempered our curiosity.

Our bond deepened as I apologized for overstepping and offered my aid in her future scams, a partnership forged in shared purpose.<br>As dawn broke, <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> uncovered the truth about the ivy blanketing the roof—living creatures held at bay by the enigmatic fog. We resolved to leave them undisturbed, hopeful for safe passage when our time in the ruins drew to a close.<br>With <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Rorschach Hastaerien Blackwell Ni'Tessine, III, Esq.\" data-href=\"Rorschach Hastaerien Blackwell Ni'Tessine, III, Esq.\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Rorschach Hastaerien Blackwell Ni'Tessine, III, Esq.\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rorschach</a> scouting ahead and <a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a>'s Shatter spell opening the way, we ventured into a hallway draped in darkness, its walls alive with moss and lichen. At its end, a door bore an unsettling inscription in <a data-href=\"Sylvan\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/sylvan.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvan</a>, speaking of corrupted fruit and poisonous ichor. The cold iron key transformed the passageway, revealing the path forward.<br>Descending into the depths, the star's song grew clearer, its melody haunting and insistent. Two doors barred our way, each demanding a tribute. Beyond them, chambers of petrified oak and earthen pots cradling Doordnn eggs. Corvaux's move to claim the intact egg unleashed the wrath of meenlocks, arachnid horrors bent on destroying innocence. Though victorious, I did not get away entirely unharmed ( nor my pride entirely unscathed ).<br>But it was the final chamber that held me captive—in a sense. There, enshrined in glass, rested a staff pulsing with the star's essence. An inexplicable connection drew me in, a note of longing, and as I reached out, the room came alive with shifting hues and resonant energies. Teal light radiated from my chest, a mirror of the staff's brilliance.<br>In a breath, I was somewhere else entirely, bound and helpless before an ancient, malevolent presence. Though, perhaps the word ‘before’ is the wrong one, for the presence was everywhere around me, in me, like an all-seeing eye, reading me like a book. Words poured forth unbidden, populating my mind with a verse steeped in foreboding shadow. It demanded a price, a piece of my very being, my core, my soul. Lost in its thrall, I relinquished the most fundamental memories shared between my mother and I, and with it, my longing for home. Though my mother's face still flickers in my mind, her light has dimmed, a fire turned to weak embers.<br>I have never experienced something as profoundly upsetting as knowing I once looked to something and someone for comfort, motivation and encouragement, only to now recall purely the factual about the memories that served that purpose; to be left unfeeling about the events that once tethered me to the Earth Plane. I feel unanchored, free-floating, and yet so incredibly heavy for it.<br>Once returned to the chamber, shaken and violated, I recited a cryptic verse as if possessed. The words I cannot remember, and perhaps it is for the better. The glass shield promptly fell away, and riddled with fear, I claimed the staff. Its power surged through me, banishing the lingering dread and melding with my own essence.<br>The star's song faded, its purpose fulfilled, leaving me forever changed. A piece of myself traded for this cosmic companion in a sense, a sacrifice I pray was not in vain.<br>Before all else, we had best leave these cursed halls. Not only did they once belong to <a data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eristalon</a>, but they still do, for if that voice, that entity, was not Eristalon himself, I'll eat both my boots. Whatever else the other chambers in this vault hold, it cannot be worth exposing ourselves to that foul presence; it cannot be worth others facing the choice between death – or somehow even worse – and sacrificing a piece of one's soul.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 33","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 33"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/player-characters/mirri.html","Vestan Tlanbourn","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","Rorschach Hastaerien Blackwell Ni'Tessine, III, Esq.","entities/player-characters/deidre.html","languages/sylvan.html","Eristalon"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-33.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1719490191429,"modifiedTime":1719490537937,"sourceSize":4223,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 33.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-33.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-34.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 34","icon":"","description":"<br>Day 1 of Flamecrest, year 515 of T.A.?<br>\nWith the weight of <a data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eristalon</a>'s violating presence still heavy upon me, I pleaded with my companions to flee the vault.

The cold iron key, our salvation, opened another hidden door at the end of the hallway ( as our original point of entry was now populated with those same vines ).<br>I don't know the path everyone took afterwards. I took a sharp left turn from the door, and then another, intent on leaving the way we came through this path clear of vines, but …<br>Our flight was not without consequence. Deidre, meaning to collapse a wall and impede our pursuers I suppose, or intent on opening another passage for our escape, instead revealed a sight that froze the blood in my veins. A dragon, immense vicious, its form entwined with vines and lichen, its eyes blazing with fury and searching, searching, searching—for the thief who stole its treasure, the star it coveted, no doubt.<br>I took comfort in knowing it couldn't see me, but I worried for how long the spell's effects would hold, and whether the dragon could ‘sense’ the star, and locate it that way—and its new wielder along with it.<br>Luck, ever the brave negotiator, attempted to parley with the enraged guardian of this petrified hellscape. He offered a trade while I tried to escape, allowing me to somehow sneak below and past the dragon without alerting it to my presence. To help Luck out, I even dropped my precious Moonsickle as part of the tribute being demanded. But the dragon scoffed, demanding the staff, bemoaning the silence of the once-resonant song.<br>The dragon's wrath was swift and merciless. It lashed out at Luck and his loyal moorbounder, <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a>, leaving them grievously wounded. Yet, through sheer determination and skill, they managed to evade the worst of the onslaught.<br>Now, my guilt set in long before—the moment I realised this was all because the staff had been plucked from its glass cage. My companions were all fighting and putting on their best acts to distract the creature from me, so the staff and I could get to safety. I couldn't just leave them behind, though, and given Luck's and Ralph's state at that point … I relinquished the staff to Luck, and implored him to take Ralph and flee, and find safety.<br>As I turned back to rejoin my companions on the roof, a figure emerged from the shadows—dark hair, red robes, a stranger whose identity remained cloaked in secrecy. Luck's hurried ( but seemingly genuine ) assurances did little to quell the unease churning in my gut, but there was no time for questions.<br>So there I stood, facing the wall I had yet to climb with that red-robed stranger halfway up its height, with whatever fear I felt before under Eristalon's crippling influence amplified yet again.<br>In that moment, though, there was gratitude, too—for <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>'s understanding, for Deidre's cleverness, for Luck's bravery and sacrifice, and <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a>’ steadfastness.

When I first appeared in Winter there was sun, and I tried to go through the <a data-href=\"Krumholtz Mountains\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Krumholtz Mountains</a> in what felt like a couple months after that. Stopped counting a long time ago, but the sun isn't here anymore just the moon. I ran into a pair of fey, and I tried to pull my usual routine on them when they asked for a gift. I found a small painting of an elf, and it was the closest thing in my pack I thought worked as a gift. I don't even remember what I said, something about it belonging to a lord. The pixies said I could pass, but the pixies lied!! I was grabbed maybe a few hours later, left hanging upside down in a rope trap. They told me it was \"too boring\" and something about teeth??? I tried telling them I had a better gift but they would not hear my pleas and left me there. <br>Theres no other word for my experience except torture, I would be left in some manner of trap for sometimes days at a time. I had enough survival experience to find my own food and water, but when the trap would release almost all of the food or water would be sabotaged. Pebbles in all the mushrooms, every animal scared off, I would try and boil drinking water from the snow but if I ever looked away for even a moment it would be knocked over or have salt poured in. I've learned how to not blink for at least 10 minute intervals while the water boils despite the harsh and cold winds just so I could consistently get safe drinking water. When I would rest, the best I could expect is to wake with pine needles in my ears and nose, sometimes poison ivy or similar. Don't even get me started on the singing, even now I swear I can still hear it. After a while of this, or if I got too comfortable, I was put back into another trap so the cycle could start all over again.<br>But finally after only gods know how long, some travelers seeking to journey past Krumholtz Mountains appeared. I wasn't really paying attention at first, normally I am very perceptive but however long I have been in this cycle I've never spotted a single animal or other living thing besides those pixies and the plant life. I got used to not really needing to keep an ear out. When they got very close, and I finally noticed the sound of crunching snow barely a few feet from me, I jumped a little bit. I surely looked and sounded crazy, I might be just a little crazy. I mean what other kind of person has to keep an eye on their shadow?<br>At first I thought them some new trick, something to spice up the entertainment I was bringing the pixies. Or maybe the pixies were still angry with the threats I made and brought people to hurt me, the largest of the group certainly looked like they could. Never again am I threatening a fey I can't beat. But no, just travelers like I was who must now bring a gift so they can pass. Some fine gifts, stories, performances, these pixies had a particular interest in either teeth or disturbing events.<br>Had I known ages ago that is what made for a good gift to these pixies, I would've never been trapped on this mountain. Early into my banishment to Winter but after the moon replaced the sun I fought off an ogre and pulled its tooth out. I couldn't really say why I chose to do it, but I carved the word \"moon\" into the tooth. But, I do want to remember my hardships. In no shape or form does this punishment fit the crime and unless the coward died first, <a data-href=\"Ambassador Ushan\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Ambassador Ushan\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ambassador Ushan</a> hasn't seen the last of me. I gifted the tooth to the pixies, the quiet one was very quick to snatch it from me. Then, finally, I was free to leave this mountain. <br>I chose to follow those Travelers as they marched onward, they're headed to one of the other courts, following a vision in their minds of <a data-href=\"Golden Oak\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Golden Oak\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Golden Oak</a>. While I have never left Winter, I figured I could surely at least aid them in the journey, after all I didn't learn nothing from my time in Winter. They accepted, thank the gods. We're resting in a cave now having just gotten a glimpse of the sun. I think I will stick with these people, at the very least until we've left the feywilds.

I must keep moving forward however, theres still every chance I die in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Feywild\" data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Feywilds</a> and nothing occurring in <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a> matters unless I can get there alive. <br>Following that I had an amusing arm wrestling contest with <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Aerendyl\" data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeren</a>, I hadn't expected to win really but it was nice levity. I also learned that I have some like-minded companions in this party, improves the odds I'll try and stick with them after we make it out of the Feywilds. Mirri especially, they seemed very excited to meet a fellow charlatan. <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> had a connection with the demon influence in <a data-href=\"Silver Maple\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Silver Maple\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silver Maple</a>, in the Autumn court. So we found rapport, or I hope we did, in my mission to deal with that demonic influence. Corvaux described a \"<a data-href=\"Pale Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Pale Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pale Blight</a>\" that I should take extreme caution in facing, though they also said trying would be foolish so I'm having trouble telling where I stand with them.<br>Further interesting me in sticking with this group, apparently they're interesting enough to have people attempting to assassinate them in the dead of \"night\". <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a>, a very large and intimidating member of this party, was attacked by some devil worshipping poacher with a paralytic poison. They had apparently fought a group of these before meeting me, a shame I wasn't there for it it would have been quite the memory. The assassin was fought off quickly, I managed the killing blow but truly Runa was more than tough enough to have done that themselves. <br>Runa figured that the assassin appeared in camp thanks to a magic bag they took from them earlier. There was some brief discourse between Runa and the group, the rest trying to learn more about why Runa was after these poachers in the first place. Eventually though it was settled we would see where this bag leads, try and deal with whatever or whoever's on the other side. The cave was sealed by Aeren, and a number of spells cast in preparation, that were unfortunately wasted as all of us but a now magically disguised Runa were sent directly to magic dampening cells.<br>Runa, through I can only assume was clever deception, got past a little girl that was in the other room and recognized who Runa was disguised as. After writing our names into a book and giving us each tokens stamped with the symbol of <a data-href=\"Asmodeus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Asmodeus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Asmodeus</a>, something that I picked up must've had prior meaning to this group in addition to the devil worshippers here, we were able to walk free of our cells and explore what a disembodied voice explained to us was \"<a data-href=\"Dain's Prison\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Dain's Prison\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Dain's Prison</a>\" and a demiplane. <br>As a sign off, I'm trying to steal a cold stone/gem/whatever that these people were using as a part of their cooler. Apparently it might explode if I try and chip pieces off, dying in a freezer is probably near the bottom of my desired ways to kick the bucket so I'll just stick to stealing the food if I can't get the rock.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Luck of the Draw 19","level":1,"id":"Luck of the Draw 19"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/player-characters/mirri.html","Ambassador Ushan","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html","Angel's Share","locations/feywild/feywild.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","Silver Maple","Pale Blight","Runa","Asmodeus","Dain's Prison"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-19.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1708230093000,"modifiedTime":1718986808446,"sourceSize":3994,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 19.md","exportPath":"character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-19.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-23.html":{"title":"Luck of the Draw 23","icon":"","description":"<br>Feywild journal<br>\nProperty of Luck<br>\nDay: Roughly 309 years (no wonder my back aches I'm 335 years old)<br>Ive done some more traveling with this group, and I have only become further convinced I would like to continue traveling with this group as I work on rebuilding my reputation and legacy, not that I had much of either before. Our journey has taken us to the <a data-href=\"Scarlet City\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Scarlet City\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Scarlet City</a>, finally beyond the <a data-href=\"Krumholtz Mountains\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Krumholtz Mountains</a> and very near the <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> border. To sort of catch us up on entries Ive missed, <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> had caught a disease of some kind interacting with a portal to the Abyss when they were still on the material, we have plans on journeying to <a data-href=\"Silver Maple\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Silver Maple\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silver Maple</a> and dealing with the pale blight, we went aboard the <a data-href=\"Crimson Gaze\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Crimson Gaze</a> to party, fight, drink, and get our fortunes read, I ended up learning exactly how long Ive been away by talking with the crew. Beyond that, mostly shopping for silver, pale blight protection, and my brand new companion <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> an absolutely beautiful moorbounder that doesn't like to stay still or move from my side.<br>The previous night, after our party on the Crimson Gaze, I had gotten my first talk with <a data-href=\"Crowley\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Crowley\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Crowley</a> in quite some time. I haven't just yet explained Crowley to the party, I can't really think how to word that I have a red eyed crowlock visitor in my dreams that gives me information. Not without sounding a little crazy, though it's potentially nowhere near as alarming to this particular group as it would be for anyone else. Crowley in their typical slightly disjointed fashion informed me it was still very necessary to head to Silver Maple, two demon presences were still around, they also mentioned something about siblings that I assumed was not being literal and just referencing that others like myself were sent. Crowley also made it clear to bring silver, holy water, and plenty of food which we were able to find in spades while shopping in the Scarlet City. Well except the food, I may just gather or hunt it myself.<br>While shopping I met <a data-href=\"Josiah\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/josiah.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Josiah</a>, a merchant within the city, who had on offer a periapt that could significantly protect Ralph from the <a data-href=\"Pale Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Pale Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pale Blight</a>. It was very expensive and after all the shopping I was all but broke, so instead I offered up ranger services and have received a list of items to collect for a discount on a future item purchase. Hopefully I can gather the gold and items to be able to afford that periapt for Ralph, his safety has quickly rose to the top of my priorities. To that end, <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> has made a deal with me for the shards and powder of Flail Snail eggs she had, and I ventured north with Ralph and Corvaux to find some other items. We ended up discovering a cave leading to a Frost Salamander colony where using some rabbits I caught, a nearby tree, and rope, I had set up a simple snare trap to try and get some of the frost salamanders teeth without too taxing of a fight.<br>\nIm writing this section while we wait for a salamander to get stuck in the trap, will update after the fight.<br>Update: It immediately went wrong. First of all it was MASSIVE I knew some surface level knowledge but I certainly wasn't expecting an ice breathing lizard the size of two or three moorbounders put together. Ralph had to pull out of the fight almost immediately, I spent a considerable amount of time just trying to keep them standing and taking mostly missed shots on the salamander with my bow. Corvaux thankfully is an extremely capable fighter, they handled the fight almost single-handedly. In a moment of shock and terror Ralph went down from the salamanders frost breath but I was able to heal them with my slumbering dragon vessel. Basically the only reason we survived is because my trap managed to hold the entire time, though Corvaux might've somehow won regardless given how much damage they dealt.<br>In the end, we got out of it with three of the salamanders teeth, Corvaux didn't really get anything out of this fight though so I should figure out some way to repay them for the help, it wouldn't have been possible without them after all. I've also decided <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> simply won't be aiding in future combats, I can train them as a hunting/scouting companion instead of a battle one so they never get that close to death again. Frankly I'm a bit ashamed of how little help I was on the martial front of that fight, I need to be so much stronger than I currently am. We're resting for the night in the city and I believe we're headed to Autumn next. Very excited to finally be out of Winter after so long.<br>Note to self: Absolutely NEVER sell that slumbering dragon vessel, <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> would have died without it.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Luck of the Draw 23","level":1,"id":"Luck of the Draw 23"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["Scarlet City","Krumholtz Mountains","locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","Silver Maple","entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html","entities/animal-companions/ralph.html","Crowley","entities/npcs/josiah.html","Pale Blight","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","entities/animal-companions/ralph.html","entities/animal-companions/ralph.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-23.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1711286167000,"modifiedTime":1718986808598,"sourceSize":4830,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 23.md","exportPath":"character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-23.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-24.html":{"title":"Luck of the Draw 24","icon":"","description":"<br>Feywild journal<br>\nProperty of Luck<br>\nDay: Not just yet, almost?<br>Upon waking we were greeted to <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> explaining <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a> has left, leaving a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Runa > Departure\" data-href=\"Runa#Departure\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa#Departure\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">note</a> behind that they have left to the <a data-href=\"Ironwood Citadel\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Ironwood Citadel\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ironwood Citadel</a>.

Despite that we did all make our way forward, finding ourselves in front of a shrine to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The Raven Queen\" data-href=\"The Raven Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Raven Queen</a>.<br>There was also the sound of a lute playing a strange haunting song, the source of which was someone with Elvish features named <a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a>. Initially I felt that she spoke like a liar, or like someone who wanted something, I haven't met many who would offer so many compliments and not have ulterior motives. Perhaps I was getting the wrong idea from them but despite how they acted they were still asking for our help, something I wasn't going to walk away from. Apparently a group of masked people had somehow bound her to the area, specifically a mansion around here. Where we found her was roughly as far as she could go. When I asked why the only reason she gave was that they wanted her talents as a bard.<br>I asked that I get a brief moment in the shrine before leaving to help Deidre. I wasn't actually expecting others to already be inside, other worshippers for the Raven Queen. Deidre had mentioned she would visit the shrine often as well, though I don't believe she is an actual devotee. I took the opportunity to speak with one of the three tending to the shrine, ensure that I was worshipping the Raven Queen properly and to learn how I might better serve them. I even wish to move forward as one of their clerics if I can.<br>After that brief discussion, I was informed of a worshipper who was meant to collect offerings near a fallen but still living tree that had not returned with those items. I agreed to retrieve those items, made my own offerings of items I collected in Winter to the shrine, then headed out to find those offerings and help Deidre. <br>We have approached the fallen tree, and <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> warned us of danger, Deidre vanished with invisibility and Corvaux is approaching the tree.

Though I really should get better at writing down my experiences in the Feywild.<br>In short and not necessarily in order, we explored the manor briefly and I personally got to enjoy sunlight for the first time in I don't know how long. The manor Deidre was bound to seems to have belonged to <a data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eristalon</a>, but where we needed to go to free Deidre was actually below the manor. There were several revelations related to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Aerendyl\" data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeren</a> and a journal they've been carrying around which had us certain this journal cannot ever end up in the wrong hands, not to mention an eventual reveal that a hags eye was watching Aeren. We learned Deidre doesn't have a pulse, explored the strange place under the manor which was full of various treasures, strange items, and unfortunately many many dead to the point that more than one room had the very walls packed with bones.<br>I'm still not quite sure how exactly we freed Deidre, when we found the room with a strange ritual circle surrounding a place someone would be chained to the floor, <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> had us leave the room. I was wary, but there wasn't much I could do alone to press for answers. But after some time, we all met up again and Deidre said they could leave this place. Before that however Deidre wanted to lay to rest her friend <a data-href=\"Kai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Kai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Kai</a>, which led to us entering the aforementioned 100ft hole. I feel like I should've done more in that place, I worship a death goddess and contributed little more than vague memories of elven funeral rites. I know in my heart that I can contribute more, I cannot disappoint them.<br>Im not sure how to explain the 'star' Aeren was able to hear while we were down there. To him it was deafening but it took some effort for me to hear and then make out words from the noise. We were going to take a boat and find the source of this noise but the boat belonged to a myconid a short distance from the vessel. They introduced themselves as <a data-href=\"Chip\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Chip\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Chip</a>, and mistook me for a member of the '<a data-href=\"Rusted Swords\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Rusted Swords\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rusted Swords</a>' I decided to go with the lie, maybe gain just that much more favor at least with Chip. I did have to explain myself to Deidre, who believed my lie and wondered if I knew her brother. I admittedly felt a bit guilty for the lie after that.<br>Since Chip wanted to take us to a settlement called the <a data-href=\"Blight Commune\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Blight Commune\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Blight Commune</a>, I returned to the surface along with Aeren and Deidre. Aeren and myself collected our animal companions while Deidre packed some of her things that remained in the manor. The three of us took a surface route that would be easier on <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> before rejoining the others.<br>Before we continued following Chip to the Blight Commune however, Mirri had many words for us regarding <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a> and our reckless behavior. Words that I don't care to repeat here, but ones that resonated with me when they were said. I think I've slipped too far into old habits, getting cocky and reckless and fantasizing again about all the fun lies and scams I could pull. As if I learned nothing at all being sent to <a data-href=\"Winter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter</a>, or getting myself stranded in the Krumholtz Mountains. I even went and managed to get myself cursed, it seems like an insignificant one right now but I don't think I could admit it to the party after everything that got said. Especially not after seeing that look Mirri had when Aeren revealed <a data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malachai</a> was the 'Stonecutter' aka Aerens father.<br>I must better myself, act out the will of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The Raven Queen\" data-href=\"The Raven Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Raven Queen</a>, be of genuine aid to my new allies, and survive to finally leave the Feywild. If I cannot improve, then I just might get myself or others killed.<br>P.S.

Crowley made mention of a demons name, and I believe reference to one of us who could out wit it in its own language, however in the end it seemed the best solution was in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Aerendyl\" data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeren</a> finding a portal to the Abyss that already exists and throwing the bottle in before we close it.<br>I barely get to wake up before strange things occurred however, Mirri had exited their trance and summoned an ooze familiar. Unfortunately also summoning or catching the attention of something else. We fought some form of apparition, determined to harm Mirri, I only barely glimpsed the thing before the fight because of what appeared to be Crowley.<br>\nIt was fought off quickly but not before it managed to hurt Mirri, I will keep a more vigilant eye out for this thing in the future. We learn that the demon in the bottle is from the 333rd layer of abyss, a layer that also holds <a data-href=\"Orcus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Orcus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Orcus</a>. Very concerned about about my axe which was on the same table as the wretched demon bottle I revealed that I've foolishly gotten myself cursed by this axe, and had Mirri try to identify it. We didn't learn much that I hadn't already known.<br>We did however discuss ways to rid Aeren of that hags eye, such as feeding it to something which made me think of Xorns (potentially a Xorn could eat this axe?), there was also the option of trying to pass this eye onto Vestan or throwing it into the abyss along with the bottle. We didn't exactly come to any agreement yet on how to dispose of the eye, beyond light mention of looking for a Xorn. Instead we sent off <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Master Silo\" data-href=\"Master Silo\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Master Silo\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Silos</a> frog familiar to let him know we were ready to help him, we did promise after all.<br>I did discuss one more thing with Crowley, as I had concerns whether or not I've been traveling with the undead.

There was some understanding that these vines were growing from and potentially moving something much bigger but we figured we could just run past and get out of dodge fast enough.<br>I was the fastest initially, I got out and realized more vines creeped their way in through the smashed wall. I scrambled past them and back to our animals. I took a shot at one vine which was shockingly brittle (perhaps from the cold fog?) and would've fought more when a voice shouted in <a data-href=\"draconic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/draconic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">draconic</a> \"THIEF\" and \"FOOL\".

Deirdre shattered a number of them and the surrounding wall, briefly I hoped it would offer a quick escape but that notion was dismissed when I saw the massive strange half plant and half dragon hanging from the roof of this place.<br>Briefly through a stroke of luck beyond anything I've ever experienced before I managed to talk this dragon into discussing tribute, in return for, I assumed, us taking that staff. Unfortunately, the mere trinkets I had to offer were little more than offensive. My life was frankly saved thanks to Deirdre getting the dragons attention. I didn't see what they did but it certainly worked. I was able to get away on <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a>s back, the lead lined box left behind as part of my failed tribute.<br>From there I got a couple shots off on the dragon with my longbow, I briefly spotted <a data-href=\"grout\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/grout\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">grout</a>, a once again disguised <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> who I pray has one hell of a plan, and the invisible Aeren who after some quick conversation entrusted me with the staff so I could escape with it on Ralphs back.

They made horrendous noise, all heavy armor and chainmail, so I slipped off on my own to get a better vantage point. My two “companions” made their way into the farm cabin, taking on the two guards, and I seized my chance to slip upstairs and corner whoever was waiting up there. I Charmed him and finally, after all of these years, got some answers: he was communing with someone named <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" data-href=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Zirel</a> in a place called the <a data-href=\"Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fallen Halls of Eristalon</a>.<br>\nThe cleric, <a data-href=\"Halek\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Halek\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Halek</a>, was looking for a girl, the daughter of the farmers who lived here, whose blood coated the walls of their home. The half-orc was against me killing the cultists outright, as if they deserved any sort of mercy. Regardless, I stripped them bare and pocketed their daggers to sell later. I may not have been allowed to slit their throats, but I could, at least, humiliate them. From there, we headed to the barn, where I found a tiefling and a strange elf in a cage. I cleaved the tiefling’s mind in two with Dissonant Whispers and we managed to free the caged man, <a data-href=\"Malachai\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malachai\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malachai</a>.<br>He knew the bastard’s name!

I wish I could help him, I wish I could tell him that this will get better, but I don’t know if it will. I don’t know. What is clear to me is just how… lucky I ended up. His pact and mine are so vastly different. My patron is perhaps the only true friend I have ever known and even that word, friend, is too small a word to encompass the truth of it. And the worst of it is that I cannot even begin to articulate how my pact came about because—<br>Ugh. I encouraged Aerendyl to do something foolish to take their eyes off of me. His attempts to… “woo” <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a> were painful to witness, but they made for a fine distraction.

Our guide fed some Redcaps with blood to keep them sated and I followed suit. I don’t have any plans on waking the dead. Thaddeus, on the other hand, gave a very impassioned speech about what he might learn of lost civilizations if he had the option to rouse the dead. He also wants an interview with a Redcap and a Revenant if he can find them.<br> Thaddeus is a gift wrapped in silver ribbons for someone like him.<br>That is what worries me the most.<br>We’ve found a big hole. Runa’s poachers are probably waiting at the bottom for the monster that has made its nest there. We’ve set up camp to wait for these poachers to return.

The ones that I could not break off. I know that they vanished after… after and I never did figure out where they went. Only the cost of their removal.<br>Aerendyl said they were made of cold iron. I don’t care what it’s called, I want to be as far away from it as possible. The very touch of it brings back memories that I don’t want to endure more than I already do.<br>First Runa, bleeding and hurt. Then the iron. I shouldn’t have snapped at her but all I could think of was…<br>Stop getting attached, Mirri, you thrice-damned, hypocritical fool. You know how it will end. They are your friends as long as you are useful to them. So be useful.<br>Runa freed us by adding us to a ledger for these Bloody Poachers. Their base, if that is what this place is, is open to us and what little I’ve found so far only confirms the half-orc’s words—these are “bad people.”<br>I know she doesn’t like me and probably never will, but Runa at least felt comfortable dumping some magical equipment onto me. I can do that. I can be useful. I can be a mage if that is what they need. Be useful.<br>Find out who’s singing.

I found a forge containing many magical things, including flail snail eggs and a strange metal I could not identify. It looked rusted, but it radiated heat. I decided it was best to be cautious and avoid touching it until the others could look for themselves. I packed the eggs and some of the notes into my bag. The notes were either written in a cypher or in Infernal, neither of which I could understand at that moment.<br>The goblin child, <a data-href=\"Jinx\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinx</a>, was singing to a prisoner, someone by the name of <a data-href=\"Tanis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tanis</a>. Someone that <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a> knew.<br>I know nothing of the <a data-href=\"Orcish\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Orcish\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Orcish</a> tongue, know nothing of what they said to each other, but I do not have to. I understand. I understand so thoroughly it makes me heartsick. We are more alike than I believed us to be, Runa and I. I understand the violence they have inflicted upon these poachers better than anyone. I know what pain they have endured in silence, their reluctance to speak of it save to ask for help in killing the people who took everything from them.<br>Jinx was frightened of us, all of us, and I can tell that she has been treated cruelly by the poachers who operate here. Tanis informed us that <a data-href=\"Dain's Prison\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Dain's Prison\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Dain's Prison</a> is a demi-plane that belongs to a tiefling wizard called <a data-href=\"Spite\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Spite\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spite</a>. I wasted no time insisting that we leave as soon as possible. Another mage like him is the last thing we need.<br>On our way out, I swore I could see a face in the flames of the braziers we passed. I stole the ledger bearing our names—if what I saw was real, if our trespass was noticed, I’d rather not hand the bastard our identities to make it easier to find us.<br>We rested for a while, allowing Tanis some time to recover. She is a former Captain of the Wall, guarding <a data-href=\"Sylvari\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/sylvari/sylvari.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sylvari</a> from the <a data-href=\"Yew Forest\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Yew Forest\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yew Forest</a>. To my surprise, she knew of him and said that he had been thrown out of the <a data-href=\"Ironwood Citadel\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Ironwood Citadel\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ironwood Citadel</a> several times. Though I have hunted him across all of Sylvari, it still shocks me how infamous he truly is… and it infuriates me to know how long he has gotten away with so much.<br>I had been trying to distract myself by making tea and caring for the little one. Jinx insisted she is not a child, she’s 16. Luck was shocked to learn my age, as if 112 is not only a decade out from standard elven adulthood &amp; Corvaux is senior to me, is she not?<br>\nOur playful banter soon turned serious and we argued about what to do with the bag. I was in favor of laying a trap, but in the end, Corvaux placed it into their bag of holding.<br>\nWe packed up camp, once again setting course for Autumn. We met the pixies again and I admit, I could not come up with another tale for the life of me. Carrying Jinx on my back reminded me of happier times, of days filled with sunshine and laughter, of <a data-href=\"Paelias\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Paelias\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Paelias</a> begging me to do the trick with my ears.

What awe at the beauty I saw there, from the twisting branches of the massive tree at the heart of the city to the colors of fall, was soon overshadowed by the fact that the <a data-href=\"Crimson Gaze\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Crimson Gaze</a> was docked here.<br>The Gaze! That beautiful ruby beauty! I couldn’t believe my eyes, but there she was, just as incredible as she was the last time I saw her. Oh, to think that I had been so young that first time, stuttering out my very first alias to get myself aboard. My first proper drink, my first proper kiss… Ember. That was her name. I remember her like it was yesterday. She had the most incredible eyes.<br>And I remember the friends I went with, the Moon Rats like myself who had heard every story, no matter how outrageous, same as me. There was <a data-href=\"Ros\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Ros\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ros</a>, <a data-href=\"Caper\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Caper\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Caper</a>, and <a data-href=\"Eilonwy\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eilonwy\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eilonwy</a>. Funny, to think back on them now. I wonder where they are now, how they are doing. I heard Ros and Eilonwy were married at some point, but we had moved in with <a data-href=\"Rodan\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Rodan\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rodan</a> by then and I was too busy caring for <a data-href=\"Paelias\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Paelias\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Paelias</a> to slip away to attend. Not that I think either of them would want their ex-girlfriend at their wedding, all things considered.<br>\nRegardless, I did not hesitate to relay to my companions how desperately I wanted to visit the ship. I could have waxed poetic for hours. Before we went out, we stopped by the inn, <a data-href=\"Froggit About It\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/businesses/froggit-about-it.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Froggit About It</a>, and there, <a data-href=\"Tanis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tanis</a>, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>, and <a data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aerendyl</a> decided they would much rather sleep than explore. Their loss! <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> and I made for the shops, grabbing more suitable outfits for such a grand occasion. <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a> declined a change of clothes, but I could hardly care when Corvaux appeared looking like that. Gods save me, I might require a room to myself before the night is over. I haven’t… well, I cannot say I haven’t indulged since my last great heartache, but pathetic one-night-stands have never sated me. If Corvaux asks, though, the answer is a resounding yes.<br>I found myself tongue-tied as soon as we stepped aboard. It was overwhelming, standing on those red decks again, feeling like a giddy teen. Runa, Corvaux, and I all agreed to a fight, providing entertainment and hoping to win a bit of coin, too. I kept an eye on <a data-href=\"Jinx\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinx</a> while we waited for our turn.

I hate everything and everyone, most notably myself.<br>Such a stellar start to my day, honestly. Not only am I fighting the hangover sent from the depths of the Abyss itself, but <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> delightedly informed all of us that they have an ATD… an abyssally transmitted disease, or <a data-href=\"phage\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/phage\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">phage</a>. I thought it was a joke, at first, some ribbing about something I certainly thought about doing with her, but hadn’t actually done, but no. It was real. So, to the healers we go to ensure we haven’t all been infected with whatever nasty shit came out of the business end of some demon.<br>The healer examined us and gave us a run-down of what to expect. This particular phage comes from the 108th layer of the Abyss. Corvaux asked me how I knew of that layer, but I managed to avoid answering. If he’s meddling with it, tearing haphazardly into it, he’s risking more lives than I thought. I need to find out what he wants there, what is driving him and his followers to seek it out… and if they have some form of protection from it.<br>Speaking of protection… I pulled Captain Havoc aside last night. We spoke of <a data-href=\"Jinx\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinx</a> and my desire to have her join the crew of the <a data-href=\"Crimson Gaze\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Crimson Gaze</a> in the hope that they might be able to protect her from the poachers… and anything else that might want to harm her. She’s a brilliant child, intelligent and eager to please, and as much as it breaks my heart to leave her behind, I know it’s for the best. She will be safer when she is not with me. We meet with the captain at midday.<br>Oh, and by the way, Corvaux is from <a data-href=\"Yewdon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/yewdon/yewdon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yewdon</a>. The Cursed Forest. And I thought my origins were cause for concern. Well, at least if it outs, I will be in grand company, I suppose.<br>What strikes me the most is how… hopeless Corvaux is about the <a data-href=\"Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Blight</a> and Yewdon. She says there is no hope for her home, and while I cannot find it in myself to argue the finer points with her, knowing only an outsider’s perspective… it just… It hits close. I know that hopelessness in my own way. That loneliness. I’m tempted to call in favors that don’t even exist if it might make a difference. But I know better.<br>After the healers took <a data-href=\"Tanis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Tanis</a> and Jinx, the rest of us headed out to finish our shopping. We first stopped by a menagerie for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a> to purchase his moorbounder. Oh, the beasties! I could have blown every gold in my purse then and there, but I remembered my list of components for finding my Familiar and instead settled for bullying <a data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aerendyl</a> into adopting an ice wolf pup.<br>\nHis name is <a data-href=\"Grout\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Grout\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grout</a> and he is the most adorable thing!!! Those little teeth will be man-maulers in no time! Oh, I can’t wait to see how this goes. Aeren refused to allow me to shirk responsibility, so we are co-parenting our pup. I’d be a terrible mother, but a stepmother? I think I can manage that just fine, so that’s how I’ll approach it.<br>We also swung by the <a data-href=\"Drunken Cantor\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Drunken Cantor\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Drunken Cantor</a>, where we met the shopkeeper, <a data-href=\"Josiah\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/josiah.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Josiah</a>. I purchased what I needed for my spells, as well as a sparking ring, just for fun. I also grabbed a pair of goggles, a scarf, gloves, as well as a change of clothes if we happen to run into the <a data-href=\"Pale Blight\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Pale Blight\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pale Blight</a> that <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> warned us about. I also nabbed a small trinket for Jinx… something to remember me by.<br>I split off from my companions and took Jinx shopping for some proper pirate attire. I didn’t want to get her hopes up too high, but I would do anything to ensure she gets a position on that ship. I cannot take her into a fight against him. I can’t… I can’t endure that again. We met with the captain, <a data-href=\"Wisp\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Wisp</a>, <a data-href=\"Grace\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/grace.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Grace</a>, and <a data-href=\"Confidence\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/confidence.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Confidence</a>. They asked their questions and got answers they seemed to like… up until the moment <a data-href=\"Jinx\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinx</a> left to explore the ship with Grace and the captain called me out for my marks.<br>I expected that, and half-lied my way through it. What I did not expect was to be asked if I wished to join them as well.<br>\nIn another life, in my youth, I would have jumped at the opportunity. I would have given everything up then and there if it meant that kind of freedom. I have long admired and dreamed of that ruby ship, of her crew, of a life untethered. There was a time I would have said yes.<br>But they asked me if I wished to be free of my Pact. I did not lie in saying that it was him who did this to me, but… I could never abandon <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Hallow\" data-href=\"Hallow\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hallow</a>. I could never willingly leave her behind. Yes, I have my gripes with how the Pact came to be, with the fact that we were both robbed of our choice, but… I will stay with Hallow until my last breath is squeezed from my corpse and not a moment before.<br>It is just one more dream to be forgotten. No, passed on. Jinx will thrive here, I can tell. And who knows? Maybe I will see her again when the ship next makes port in <a data-href=\"Solantha\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Solantha\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Solantha</a>. What a sweet reunion that might be…<br>Until then, I’m off to train with Confidence. I’ve long been able to use both hands for many things, including writing, so I’m eager to properly learn to wield dual swords and forget the sour taste in the back of my mouth that tells me I am losing, once again, a chance at a good life.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Mirri 22","level":1,"id":"Mirri 22"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","phage","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html","entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/yewdon/yewdon.html","Blight","entities/npcs/tanis.html","entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html","entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html","Grout","Drunken Cantor","entities/npcs/josiah.html","Pale Blight","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/grace.html","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/confidence.html","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html","entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html","Solantha"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/mirri-22.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1711285047000,"modifiedTime":1718986809691,"sourceSize":5427,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Mirri 22.md","exportPath":"character-logs/mirri-22.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/mirri-23.html":{"title":"Mirri 23","icon":"","description":"<br>End of day 7 in the Feywilds<br><a data-href=\"Jinx\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Jinx</a> was accepted into the crew!

A favor is a powerful thing to have in our line of work, so I’ll make it count.<br>Other than that, the rest of the day, for some of us, at least, was not particularly eventful.

While their drinks seemed enticing, my head is still pounding, so I figured it was best if we actually recover before another night of partying.

We explored the massive accommodations, scrambling up the sides of chairs to reach the top of the table, standing beside a bed bigger than any of us could have imagined! <a data-href=\"Aerendyl\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Aerendyl</a> went for the massive bath, intent on a swim, and I found myself climbing up the bookshelves to a swing on the bough of a bonsai tree.

I wasn’t paying much attention to where they were going. I’m after one of those cinnamon rolls when I land this next jump from the swing to the bed.<br>Luck and Corvaux returned with <a data-href=\"Ralph\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ralph</a> the Moorbounder in tow after not just flirting with Death, but kissing Death with tongue. Whatever creature they decided to go after was more than a match for them. They almost killed the pet they’ve had for less than a day! Maybe a grandiose favor is exactly what I should ask for if this is how a hunting trip goes.<br>We’ll be turning in for the night soon. Corvaux and I are going to try and knock Aeren off the bed, first, though.

Her name is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Deidre\" data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deirdre</a>. She has elven features, but they’re more delicate, almost faerie-like. I’m assuming she’s a native of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Feywild\" data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Feywilds</a>, perhaps. And she immediately began buttering us up, asking if we could help free her from her captors. Apparently she is tethered or trapped by a cult of some kind, wearing animal masks. It would be infinitely satisfying to put them down.<br>\nWe stopped into the temple briefly for Luck. Deidre and I flirted a little because I simply cannot help myself. When was the last time a relationship with a bard fond of the color black went well for me? Never. It has never gone well for me. Don’t even think about it, Mirri.<br>\nAeren helped me find a solid stick of rowan wood to use. I explained its purpose and what it might do to help in our future endeavors.<br>We left the temple and continued on our way to free Deirdre.

As we neared the “manor” that <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Deidre\" data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> told us about, I was surprised to see not a house, but a massive tree. It wasn’t until we got much closer that I saw the stained glass windows and carved steps. Once inside, we started to explore, poking around every crevice and destroyed room. Gods, how long has this place been in pieces? Or, more concerning, how long has Deidre been here?<br>\nAs we climbed the tower, feeling the beginnings of exhaustion in my bones, we came at last to the living space and there, upon the head of a gaudy statue, was a jester’s hat fit for a king of fools. I had to have it, so once it was secured, I continued my exploration. Deidre’s Alarm Spell was set at the door, though half of it was just the word “beans” written over and over again in various tongues. None of the traps we have seen were dangerous—they were warnings only. Strange.<br>\nCorvaux and I spoke with Deidre about <a data-href=\"Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eristalon</a>, though we did not get far. Her captors were connected to Eristalon, somehow, though getting information from anyone here about it is like pulling teeth. Deidre was a pet bard, bound to this place and forced to entertain.<br>\nI wanted to rest for a while, but Corvaux called me upstairs and I am so glad that they did! There was an art gallery there, filled with cobwebs and strange items. And there was a blue dragon egg, just there for the taking. While <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a> was busy breaking strange stones growing from plants, I swiped the egg, realizing it was hollow. The three books nearby described the dragons shown in the decorations all around, a blue dragon, a gold dragon, and a jade dragon. These hunters, Deidre’s captors, were part of an organization called the <a data-href=\"Furthest Branch\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Furthest Branch\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Furthest Branch</a>.

Now that my work is finished and I’m not being constantly interrupted in the midst of extremely careful mathematical calculations and careful wording to make Abyssal as inviting as possible, given the nature of the language, I can pay attention to whatever it was that <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> and Aeren thought was so bloody important.<br>Right.

This Stonecutter is ancient, even by my standards. Aeren confirmed it—this journal is nearly 500 years old. The contents of this journal are…<br>Gods, I am shaking with fear. He can never be allowed to get his hands on this. I like Aerendyl, however irritating he is at times, but if it comes to it… Over and over, this journal details one thing: souls are the purest and most concentrated power in the universe… and he has tried to take mine. He failed once.<br>If he knows the truth—he will not fail again.<br>\nI am trying to swallow past my own heart lodged in my throat and focus on the task at hand. To undo such an enchantment or curse requires one of two things: delicate handiwork or brute strength. Thankfully, I have the former in spades.<br>\nWe’ve headed downstairs. Corvaux is working on the door that leads below, where whatever it is that holds Deidre here is located and—<br>\nWhat the fuck do you mean Deidre has no pulse?<br>Gods. There is no pulse at all. She is as cold as death. What the fuck is going on here?<br>I will not let Deirdre out of my sight until I know what is really going on here. My companions are so quick to trust, even Luck, who I thought would know better. We have no idea who she is, nor what waits for us below. This place belonged to Eristalon himself, if the gaudy statues are any indication. And yet, these fools I travel with are turning a blind eye. I know I am guilty of falling for whatever honeyed words drop from a pretty face, but this is too much, even for a tried-and-true fool like myself. No pulse, blamed on the “curse.” Telling us absolutely nothing about what we are facing. Someone is going to get hurt.<br>\n. Or worse. They will be absolutely powerless against the honey-sweet manipulations of someone like him. And I will be delivering fresh victims to his doorstep. I was hard on Thaddeus for this very reason, and now I see it in the rest of them. I can’t watch this happen again.<br>The only good thing that has come from this is that we are all now 2,000 gold richer… and Aeren was bloodied by a living suit of armor. Was it petty to chastise him like a child, as he did to me, though I am more than twice his age? Yes. Do I feel bad about it? Not in the slightest. But we will talk about that another time, when I am not watching Deidre like a hawk.<br>We have left the treasure room behind and come to a tomb. The smell is unbearable, though only Corvaux lost her breakfast. Two of the coffins were open, but one is empty. Much as I want to investigate closer, Deirdre has stepped into the next room and I intend to follow.

In the time between entries I have put efforts toward restudying all of my work, the works of other archeologists if it is for artifacts of a similar time, and as of today visiting The <a data-href=\"Halls of Ancestry\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Halls of Ancestry\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Halls of Ancestry</a>. As I understand it, it is a small and very old archive of information related to the dragons and those of draconic ancestry. Unfortunately, like many things in my life these last few months, things took a turn for the worse. I had expected to gain access to the library, do a cursory search for helpful information, and try to figure out how much of my time the information was worth. <br>Rather, it started normal. The entrance was well hidden, even to someone who knew what to look for. It blends in almost looking like nothing other than a simple cave entrance. Roughly at the same time, an Emerald Dragonborn came upon the entrance with me. They introduced themselves as <a data-href=\"Lady Liatris\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Liatris\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Liatris</a>, they appeared to have a particular interest in my familiar, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Obsidian\" data-href=\"Obsidian\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sid</a>. We shared some brief conversations about smugglers and archeology before entering the library. Sid sensed something as we entered, I sniffed the air and noticed the smell of burning papers. Together, Lady Liatris and I rushed inside immediately assuming a fire was burning in the library. Having caution for my safety, I used Sid to scout ahead. Lady Liatris used some manner of magic to take on a starry form, had the situation not been so dire I may have paid enough attention to describe it.<br>\nSid pressed onward for me, I observed through their eyes a masked individual attempting to pry something from the wall. I chose to cast an invisibility spell upon Lady Liatris who followed but did not seem to immediately notice the man, I then spoke through Sid to warn them and had Sid hide on the ceiling. Unfortunately, the invisibility ended up being of little help to us, the masked thief seemingly gave up on their task and ran through the library away from us. Lady Liatris gave chase, I took refuge within my ring so that Sid could get me there much faster than my own feet could. The thief ran into the burning library, got around a corner, and seemed to vanish. Thinking they had got away, I left my ring and sent Sid to inspect where we had first spotted the masked thief.<br>This seemed to have been a very lucky decision on my part, Sid sent simple messages to me that conveyed a strange metallic creature had taken up the work the thief abandoned, prying what I later learned was a topaz from the wall. Lady Liatris in the meanwhile managed to find the thief, hiding just out of sight. They seemed keen on the immediate execution of our thief but rather I chose to enchant the thief into being willing to answer our questions once the flames burning these very valuable books had been put out. While I did my best to save the books, Lady Liatris assisted Sid in recovering that topaz and killing the creature which left behind a small vial of green liquid upon its destruction.<br>\nWhen the fires were put out, and Lady Liatris was present for questioning this thief, we were able to gleam some important information. This person, or others that may be down here with him, were indeed the ones to set this fire. I tried to gleam specific information but it wasn’t very clear to me why they were doing these things, who was involved, what those mechanical creatures are, and several other things. In response to my asking about the strange creatures, if those were theirs, they replied “We have many gifts.” when questioning why they would do this the common response was, and I am paraphrasing, “In with the new, out with the old.” or “Make room for the new.”<br>I had hoped to keep the mask, despite their vague and prideful answer to the question \"Is the mask all your group will need to identify you by?\" I presumed the mask might help deal with the thief's allies. However in Lady Liatris’ “excitement” while disposing of the thief, the mask and portions of the robe were dissolved. I would like to note for posterity, that my opinions on violent resolution are unchanged I simply didn’t suppose I could stop Lady Liatris, who seemed very keen on killing the thief. I suppose I cannot blame them given the importance a place like this library and temple must hold to themselves especially. In the meanwhile, I attempted to find any of the information I had come to this library for, no such luck but I only had a short time to search so it was unlikely I’d find much amongst the half-burned shelves of books.<br>\nTogether Lady Liatris and I decided to search the library for this supposed group the thief was with, we entered the temple portion of this library where more of those mechanical creatures were spinning green webs across portions of the temple. The temple seemed to be a worshipping place to a draconic being called “Nexus” a subject that Lady Liatris knew more than I, though I took notice of the old statue and prayers that were etched into the ground around it. Lady Liatris seemed to notice something I hadn’t with the strange webs and began attacking the creatures making them, we defended ourselves as they attacked in turn, destroyed one of them. We then had to chase the second as it ran across the temple, and stopped at a portion of the wall that was worn down and visibly different than the surrounding stone, the creature seemed to be looking for something there but failed to find it and chose to crawl out of view.<br>I write this entry still within the temple, my attempts at finding what that spot of the wall was hiding fruitless for the time being. I am a bit torn on whether I should continue journeying in this place with Lady Liatris. They are very adamant about finding those responsible for this attack on the library with or without me but the present danger has become very clear and leaving now would simply be an act of self-preservation. However, the mystery surrounding today's events would be truly agonizing to leave unsolved despite how little it has to do with my problems. I will have to think about this longer as we explore.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Thaddeus 0.5","level":1,"id":"Thaddeus 0.5"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["Halls of Ancestry","Lady Liatris","entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-0.5.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707077684000,"modifiedTime":1716336718000,"sourceSize":6392,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Thaddeus 0.5.md","exportPath":"character-logs/thaddeus-0.5.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/thaddeus-0.56.html":{"title":"Thaddeus 0.56","icon":"","description":"<br>Personal Diary, Entry 33, 12th of Dewfall, Year 515<br>I would love to rush to the end of todays events, I knew this would be one of those days that had multiple entries but truly I could never had predicted what was in store for me this day. However if I did that then this would not be a comprehensive entry. In my last entry I ended it off noting that we were still in the temple, <a data-href=\"Lady Liatris\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Lady Liatris\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Lady Liatris</a> and I agreed to rest in different portions of the <a data-href=\"Halls of Ancestry\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Halls of Ancestry\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Halls of Ancestry</a>. I rested in the half burned library while Lady Liatris chose to remain within the temple. I had to resummon Sid and hopefully regain the energy needed to confront what may still threaten this archive of knowledge and culture.<br>My rest went uninterrupted however, unlike Lady Liatris who informed me of voices and noises they heard in that hour. Thankfully they stayed out of sight, I shudder to imagine the guilt I would feel had something happened to them when I insisted on resting in different areas. With both of us rested however and ready to investigate we climbed the stairs that were just past where that strange creature pried a topaz from the wall.<br>A crossbow bolt almost immediately found itself sticking out from Lady Liatris's abdomen as the two of us were discussing whether or not to move stealthily. I had moved in to help Lady Liatris, whiffing a blast of eldtrich energy from the ring, my spell focus, on my right hand. Lucky for us both it seemed Lady Liatris did not need my assistance, quickly dispatching of the thief in a similar manner to the last one she killed. Which once again I'd like to repeat, if this weren't clearly a matter of life or death at this point I would be strictly against the use of violence. But people ready to shoot you in the stomach when you turn a corner don't tend to make good conversation.<br>However since it appeared Lady Liatris had the situation well in hand, I got curious about a couple features of this room. The first thing that caught my eye being a large blue crystal, even without magical aid I was able to see this bright blue crystal was emanating abjuration and conjuration. Nearby was a statue, draconic writing describing it as <a data-href=\"Pyra\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pyra</a> the Savage mage. It depicted a draconic humanoid staring directly at the crystal and with one hand outstretched. The writing around the statue made it clear that Pyra, or perhaps the crystal, required an offering of some kind. <br>My second instinct was that the thieves were going to take this crystal, or worse activating this crystal somehow worked in the thieves favor and they were prying gems from the walls to give to the statue. Unfortunately my first instinct was figuring out how to make this crystal work. The only thing of worth on my person was that topaz, and it belonged to the Halls of Ancestry in the first place so I figured perhaps this would be a fine way to return it.<br>It certainly worked, but I have to be honest what to do next had me completely stumped. The topaz vanished as soon as I offered it to the statues open palm, and behind me forming inside of the crystal was a little illusionary faerie dragon. It was curious on its surroundings, me, and Sid who was curled up inside of my hood. I tried a few things, detect magic, asking the dragon directly, though I avoided commands such as directly telling them to take care of the thieves. My assumption was that I had activated some manner of defensive magic that was here to aid in protecting the Halls of Ancestry but I had no idea how to move forward.<br>The detect magic did reveal the little dragon could breathe out healing magic, and that the statue of Pyra shined with every type of magic imaginable. But before I could come up with anything else to try Lady Liatris spoke to the dragon in <a data-href=\"Draconic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/draconic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Draconic</a>. I don't know what they discussed but when it was over the little dragon dove into the crystal and seemed to disappear. Lady Liatris informed me they were going to wake up \"The Old One.\" and when the walls began to move and shake I had a theory on what exactly that meant, and decided I shouldn't wait to double check. <br>Lady Liatris pointed out there were books in this room that could be some interest to me, I scooped up everything I could then booked it for the exit. Walls, doors, tunnels were all collapsing and something all around me shifted its weight. I barely noticed that Lady Liatris wasn't behind be as I escaped from the cavern entrance. The sight that I beheld after that is beyond words.<br>The ground heaved and split apart before me, then from the depths of the earth, a colossal form began to emerge, pushing aside tons of rock and soil as if they were mere grains of sand. It was a dragon, larger than I could ever imagine with cobalt scales to match the stone it was casting aside as it crawled from the earth and spread its colossal wings. It did not regard me in the slightest, after all to a creature of that size I was but an ant hidden behind blades of grass. Two shapes were clutched in it's claws, a massive almost L-shaped mass of rock with some wood paneling sticking out that I recognized as the library I was resting in. The other shape was not familiar, I can only assume a portion of the Halls of Ancestry I had not seen.<br>That was not the end of the day, I sent Sid into what remained of the Halls of Ancestry to find Lady Liatris and explore further. I found a room of pillars with two dragon skulls facing a flame. But the sight of that dragon \"The Old one.\" shadows over anything else I could have discovered here.<br><img alt=\"The_Old_One.png\" src=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/images/creatures/the_old_one.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Thaddeus 0.56","level":1,"id":"Thaddeus 0.56"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["Lady Liatris","Halls of Ancestry","entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html","languages/draconic.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-0.56.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707103062000,"modifiedTime":1716336957000,"sourceSize":5701,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Thaddeus 0.56.md","exportPath":"character-logs/thaddeus-0.56.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":["images/creatures/the_old_one.png"]},"character-logs/thaddeus-1.html":{"title":"Thaddeus 1","icon":"","description":"<br>Personal Diary, Entry 44, 20th of Bloomwave, year 515<br>I have journeyed to the <a data-href=\"Arkehost Oasis\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/arkehost-oasis/arkehost-oasis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Arkehost Oasis</a> on the request of a colleague of mine, I didn't stay long in town to do much but find a cheap inn and pay for a room tonight and tomorrow. With some foresight I probably could've saved a few silver but what's done is done. My colleague as well as the info I could personally gather has me understand that the dragon, \"The Old One,\" that I saw fly off with portions of the Halls of Ancestry has landed in the desert and dug itself underground. So many of my field are here to research and document the event, and in another time I'd be here for the exact same reason. Instead I've made this trek in the pursuit of knowledge of ancient artifacts.<br>Initially I hoped to find and speak with as many scholars here as I could, so many in the same place after all! However things changed once I had actually entered the desert. I passed many ancient structures, most buried in the sand, few with attempts at restoration abandoned long ago, until I came across rock walls with faded murals of a dragon-kind story of creation. I will not recount the story here as I go in depth on these things within books of mine as well as my research notes. Most interesting is that I had stumbled upon a well, almost entirely covered but with just enough room for Sid to squeeze in and explore.<br>A very long way down, but at the bottom a \"room\" or more of an expansion of the well that had walls of petrified wood. A space in the center held what appeared to be a blank sheet of parchment, and a doorway with no handle or keyhole.

I am seemingly being tested by the architects of this place, Yuan-ti architects specifically. Interestingly enough it would appear the same hands that built these ruins had worked on the <a data-href=\"Halls of Ancestry\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Halls of Ancestry\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Halls of Ancestry</a>, or perhaps someone trained under the same architect. My initial theory of this being somehow tied to the Halls of Ancestry is looking more and more accurate, though the follow-up theory of it being a portion of the very same ruins was quickly proven false. Only two rooms were carried away by that dragon, and these ruins have many more chambers than that.<br>For what reason the Yuan-ti built these testing chambers, I do not yet know. Thus far, a majority of the tests have required that I give something to some extent. In the first chamber, the one as described in my last entry, I had to write my name upon the parchment and demonstrate a few spells before the next chamber was available to me. The second chamber was a simple room with many old papers strewn about largely atop an old table in the chamber's center. Everything I could find in the room was some manner of anecdote, personal note, recipe, etc. the chamber wanted me to share personal knowledge it seemed. I offered a significant amount of unpublished findings from my research into an ancient civilization that died out over 1000 years ago. In response I was shown visually much of that same information, appearing upon the chambers ceiling, as well as gaining access to the third chamber.<br>Before I could enter the third chamber however, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Obsidian\" data-href=\"Obsidian\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sid</a> took notice of something. To my surprise, once I had sent Sid to check out whatever it heard and viewed through their senses, a small group of travelers were at the well. One of which was in a bit of a precarious situation, where it seemed they began to try scaling the 200 ft deep well without any rope or climbing kit. We exchanged some brief conversation, they seemed to take some interest in joining me in the ruins, if only due to a partial belief I may need some help. There was a dragonborn with them who claimed to know me, they did however make a remark about stealing Sid and leaving me in the well, so I do hope I didn’t acquaint myself with someone who would actually do such a thing. I briefly watched them as they began the first chamber’s puzzle, and returned to my senses to enter the third room.<br>The third chamber took me much less time than the previous two, I may have also incidentally done something other than the intended “answer” to this chamber but I have yet to make enough observations to be sure. There were four altars, three of which had statues that were depictions of various Gods, each facing a fountain at the chambers center. These Gods were of varying domain, modern relevance, and appearance so in the moment I could not see any pattern. I interacted with the fountain after noting the statues, in the water were various coins. Seeing no other immediate options and knowing that the previous two chambers required I give something, I tossed a gold piece into the water. The empty altar glowed in a strange light, and when I stood atop it I was whisked away. <br>I found myself coming down a short flight of stairs, at the bottom of which another flight leading down and a wide stone slab with a detailed statue of a violet dragon, poised in a curious manner with its head craning to see down a long hallway to the right. Light emanates from the statue, and I can just barely see the outline of a larger room.

Only days ago, I still knew next to nothing of the exact terms of my pact with my patron <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" data-href=\"Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Thousand-Eyed Deceiver\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Zirel</a>. Not that I know that much now. Since my last entry, keeping events brief, I have learned that Zirel is but one aspect of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver and they have taken on many different names as devil, demon, even celestial amongst many others. I learned that the sigil that I found was a method of summoning demons from the abyss, I fought demons. I never thought that would be a truthful statement, I don't think I wanted it to be.<br>\nMy pact has put me in the rather unfortunate situation where I will either become a vessel for Zirel, for what I assume is just a fraction of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver, so that they may escape their prison. Or, to fail as Zirel's vessel and have the bonds that hold my body together dissolve.<br>In these few days we have also picked up new friends, <a data-href=\"Runa\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Runa\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Runa</a> and <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>. Mirri is a warlock as well, but the way they speak of their patron leaves me rather envious. Though if I had my way I'd be rid of the entire thing, and back to writing about the Mythrender society.<br>\nFor a number of reasons, we have decided the next leg of our journey takes us to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Feywild\" data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Feywilds</a>. For myself, Mirri spoke of a <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>, someone who was communing with Zirel in a place called the <a data-href=\"Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fallen Halls of Eristalon</a>.<br>We entered the <a data-href=\"Winter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter</a> court what may have been two days ago, I believe time here does not work the same as on <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>, we may find we've been gone no time at all or several years longer once we return. Currently, we rest at a Remorhaz nest that was populated by poachers Runa had to deal with. We found a massive sigil of the king of hell, <a data-href=\"Asmodeus\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Asmodeus\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Asmodeus</a>, as well as a candle and blood altar within the nest. We also found pixies, warped in a way that they almost seemed more like imps.<br>I verbalized a desire to speak with a devil while telling everyone what I knew about Asmodeus. In the moment it just felt like another method of information gathering, some way for me to learn how to break my pact. Devils are pretty well known for deal making after all. <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> however gave me a much needed reality check, I should not have spoken so flippantly about making deals with any devil, let alone Asmodeus. Though while I do understand it is wrong and shortsighted, I cannot stop thinking about what I read. One of Zirels potential vessels, seemingly having gone mad with their body terribly warped. Then they simply turned to dust.<br>I thought I had made peace with my mortality but it really is different when its staring you in the face. It may be wrong but, if making a deal with a devil meant getting to live, I can't say with absolute certainty anymore I would not take that deal. I often wonder lately if I have changed in any other ways. I still have not killed, a line I'm sure to cross eventually despite my own feelings about violence. In any case, it'd be nothing but foolish for me to try and reach out to a devil, once our rest is over and we are satisfied with what we find in the nest I would much rather just be done with the place.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Thaddeus 15","level":1,"id":"Thaddeus 15"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["Thousand-Eyed Deceiver","Runa","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","locations/feywild/feywild.html","Vestan Tlanbourn","Fallen Halls of Eristalon","locations/feywild/winter/winter.html","locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html","Asmodeus","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-15.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1713730974000,"modifiedTime":1719581603028,"sourceSize":3394,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Thaddeus 15.md","exportPath":"character-logs/thaddeus-15.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/thaddeus-16.html":{"title":"Thaddeus 16","icon":"","description":"<br>Personal Diary, Entry 47, 23rd/24th? of Bloomwave, Year 515<br>This entry has been written, erased, and written again so many times that sections of it are difficult to make out.

I quickly dismissed Sid so he would remain safe, and was going to run straight for him until something began to happen with <a data-href=\"Corvaux\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Corvaux</a> as well.<br>Spoiler\n|| However, the moment between rising panic and action was much much longer for me. As we all ran, I found myself somewhere entirely different in just one step. A library of sorts, wide assortment of books, paintings depicting various stills of scenery. Including, the perspective I had just before I found myself here. A painting of my friends running to check on Corvaux, painted as if it was looking through my eyes running behind <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>. A devil named <a data-href=\"Epiphany\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Epiphany</a> sat in the library, and snapped a book closed as I appeared here.<br>\n|| In short, they served a ruler of one of the layers of hell, while I was here they asked me of my current struggles. I, regrettably, couldn't stop myself and told them everything that has been weighing on my mind with this pact. That I more than wanted a way out, I needed it. Strangely, when I spoke Ted's name it came out in <a data-href=\"Abyssal\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/abyssal.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyssal</a>. Epiphany recoiled like I had struck her when I spoke that name, said they haven't heard it in a long time. They disappeared for a few minutes afterwards, I summoned Sid and inspected the paintings. I found nothing interesting. When Epiphany returned, negotiations began.||<br>\n|| I want to return to my normal life. I could never do that if anything or anybody could still lay claim to my soul or any other part of me. So I made it immediately clear during the negotiations that my soul was not on the table. I had many stipulations, all to ensure I would have a clean severance from this contract and my pact by the end of it all. Most importantly to me, I was not going to betray my moral code any farther than I already was just speaking to this devil. Epiphany's patron wanted \"beautiful souls\", I quickly contested the notion until it was explained that this didn't necessarily mean nice or good souls. There are very much souls already bound for the hells that this devil would call beautiful.||<br>\n||I was asked to collect 3 of these souls. I felt torn, which concerned me the most. I know in my heart that the morally correct thing to have done here was deny speaking or negotiating with the devil in the slightest. But I was too scared. I don't want to betray myself, or Corvaux who had just gotten me to realize how foolish I'm acting, nor betray anyone else. But what is my future if I didn't? I could go home, leave behind my party and wait for whatever fate would befall me. I could look for another way out of my pact, but be forced to almost constantly use this pact magic just to survive with no real idea on how quickly this will lead to my success or failure as Zirels vessel. How quickly it will lead to my death.||<br>\n||I don't know what I'm dealing with, I don't know how much time I have left, I don't know if there even is another way out of this pact. I'm desperate, I'm scared, and I'm overwhelmed. I asked constant clarifying questions, anything I could think of that I wanted to know or would maybe somehow make this an easier choice for me. I was strong enough to ask for 24 hours to think on it. Then I found myself focusing on the painting, and was running again like I had never left. Though I had a new ring, for when I was ready to decide.||\n<br>As it turned out, Corvaux was seeing bodies move. It's unclear why only they could see this, but they spoke in infernal calling out to their \"lady\". <br>Spoiler\n||Thats what Epiphany called their patron, her lady, ruler of <a data-href=\"Malbolge\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Malbolge\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Malbolge</a>.|| <br>I suggested we simply leave as soon as possible, we eventually all agreed to follow this image of \"golden oak\" to <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> and search for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan</a>. After a number of hours of travel, we came across an old campsite and a pair of fey inhabitants fearing over a pair of bags on the road. My mind was elsewhere however, and perhaps not as eloquently as I could've, I broached to the party my concerns about my pact as we set up camp. I've lately realized the lengths I am willing to go to be free of my pact, and I wanted to know what my party would say.<br>Of course, I couldn't get as specific as I liked. But Corvuax, even if they apologized later, made it very clear what their gut reaction would be. But all of their potential solutions are much too slow and unreliable, I love and appreciate that they were willing to help but I simply do not have the strength to push on much longer without guarantees. Corvaux's way out seems much more appealing every passing second, but I cannot do that to the people who love me, I cannot do that to my future. I twisted the new ring on my finger, and began to bleed.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Thaddeus 16","level":1,"id":"Thaddeus 16"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html","entities/player-characters/corvaux.html","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","entities/npcs/epiphany.html","languages/abyssal.html","Malbolge","locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html","Vestan Tlanbourn"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-16.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707104354000,"modifiedTime":1719581610800,"sourceSize":5616,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Thaddeus 16.md","exportPath":"character-logs/thaddeus-16.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/thaddeus-17.html":{"title":"Thaddeus 17","icon":"","description":"<br>Personal Diary, Entry 48, The date doesn't particularly matter. <br>After twisting the ring gifted to me by <a data-href=\"Epiphany\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Epiphany</a> I had little to say to them before choosing to sign the contract. Only that I wanted, in writing, conformation that I and only I will be responsible for the collection of three beautiful souls as described in my contract. Upon my death or otherwise have an inability to complete the contract, it will simply remain incomplete. The devils aren't to involve any of my associates, friends, or family to complete the contract in my stead.<br>Then I signed it. I only wish I could've told my now ex-party not to bother searching for solutions on my behalf, but until now I couldn't speak of my contract and as such had no reason to give them not to even try. I wonder if the attempt was truly for my benefit, or just to foil the plans of a fiend. I don't pretend to believe I am making a morally right decision here, but I have few and fewer options that I am brave enough to follow through on. At least now I'll know how many people must die in my presence before my journey is over. Hells, that number can even be zero with this contract.<br>If things get more complicated, if there ends up being even further steps to my freedom after this contract, I'm going home.

My body, my mind, and my soul will never be the playthings of higher powers.<br>As stated, I have been separated from my party. Partially, perhaps mostly by choice. But also as I had predicted my choice to deal with devils was largely unacceptable to the party. Many words were shared, many threats as well. Most hurtful were <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>'s, to compare me to a vile man whom I have only had glimpses into their evil nature. I am not willing to do anything and everything to free myself of this pact or to complete any of my other goals. My character, my morality has been chipped away on my year long journey, people have already died in my presence with shocking glee or ferocity from my compatriots. Worse still when they seemed to not even regard that they have killed. How much more of myself would have been sacrificed if I continued this path? How long until I took lives with just as little thought? <br>No, I refuse to go that far. Three souls, I need not even kill them but regardless of how they are collected I will never forget the three I have chosen. Even if others choose to forgive me, I will ensure I never forgive myself for it. I refuse to allow such actions to be done without thought, without regret. And should a single thing more be asked of me, I shall refuse and return home. It has to end somewhere and I will be the one making that choice. <br>I'm returning to town, I need to gather my mind and decide the next steps of my journey.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Thaddeus 17","level":1,"id":"Thaddeus 17"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["entities/npcs/epiphany.html","entities/player-characters/mirri.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-17.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1707599762000,"modifiedTime":1719581931123,"sourceSize":3044,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Thaddeus 17.md","exportPath":"character-logs/thaddeus-17.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"entities/animal-companions/leaf.html":{"title":"Leaf","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"tag\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/?query=tag:Creature\" style=\"background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116);

charlatan, developing alternative identities as it becomes useful to her. She has been chasing <a data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan Tlanbourn</a> for 54 years, seeking justice after the death of her brother <a data-href=\"Paelias\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Paelias\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Paelias</a>, as well as answers for herself.<br>Through miscommunication or bad luck, Mirri's half brother Paelias was captured by Vestan's men, and was sacrificed in a ritual. Mirri interrupted the ritual and brought Paelias away, running for hours, before eventually realizing that her brother had died in her arms as she carried him.<br>\nWhen Mirri returned home with his body, she was exiled by her mother, who believed she had been involved with his death. <br>Mirri's connection with <a data-href=\"Hallow\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hallow</a> is an enigmatic one. Their communication is largely indirect, confined to emotions while Mirri is conscious. When she sleeps, however, they speak telepathically in what appears to be an inky void.<br>\nIn their first direct conversation, she learned that Hallow had not sought out their link, but rather had gravitated on instinct toward what she perceived to be the sole light in the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a>. Although apologetic to Mirri, acknowledging that the elf had not consented to the connection that leaves physical traces on Mirri as it grows, Mirri acts as Hallow's only tether to hope while she exists in the Abyss, a link Hallow would not choose to sever.<br>Mirri is being followed by an <a data-href=\"invisible stalker\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/invisible stalker\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">invisible stalker</a>.

Some of the oldest records in the universe can be found in the dryads' libraries. Scholars from across the realms come here to study and learn, and many study their whole life without leaving again. Autumn has the deepest connections to beasts and fauna - many have remarkable control over druidic wildshaping skills. Some Autumn courtiers live their entire life in the cities at the center of each archfey's forest, never once walking upon the ground itself. In some places, the trees reach up past the clouds, and it is said that if you climb high enough, you will find giants living in stone clouds that levitate miles above the ground.<br>\nEach forest has a certain amount of autonomy, but all are united in their deep roots and ancient histories. Autumn may lack in military strength or technological advances, but the knowledge and texts curated by the archfey are priceless.<br>\n<img alt=\"Autumn book.png\"

sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps. <br><br>In the midst of the upheaval, many strong clans and leaders took advantage, and used the rulers' absence as a chance to grab land from other seasons until the mysterious twins <a data-href=\"Frost\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/frost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Frost</a> and <a data-href=\"Thaw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/thaw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Thaw</a> rose as strong voices, and united the Season to lead them in defense of the realm. Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to primal forces - both elemental and beastlike.<br>\n<br>\nThe people of Winter are by and large very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond until death.<br>\n<br><br>Even the frozen peaks of <a data-href=\"Nordthorn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordthorn</a> cannot compare to the wind and snow of Winter. But there is a unique beauty here as well - lights of the Auroras illuminate the sky, bringing celestial spirits down to the surface.<br>\n<br>\nWinter is made up of dwarves, elves (especially Winter Eladrin, Moon Elves and Shadar Kai), genasi of all kinds, goblinkind, goliath, harengon, kenku, leonid, tabaxi, and shifters of every kind.<br>\n<br>While in the Feywild: <br>\n<br>\nDo not expect <a data-href=\"Common\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/common.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Common</a> to be spoken - many Fey will scorn those who travel to their fair realm expecting to be catered to as on the material plane. (See the back of this booklet for <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Grimkin's Guide to the Winter Court > ^14fd2b\" data-href=\"Grimkin's Guide to the Winter Court#^14fd2b\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/lore/grimkin's-guide-to-the-winter-court.html#^14fd2b\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">10 useful Sylvan phrases</a>!) <br>\nUse caution when making deals. Not every fey is looking to make off with your firstborn - but words have power. Ignorance will not excuse or exempt you from a promise made. <br>\nLeave behind your concept of living beings vs objects. In the fey courts, brooks, boulders, branches and brambles may have sapience. Take no living wood in a forest without leaving a gift, be respectful when drawing water from a spring or well. In other words, err on the side of respect. It is not often that a mountain will wake due to disrespectful footsteps, but it is not unheard of.<br> Helpful Tips from Experienced Travelers: <br>\nWhen entering and exiting the <a data-href=\"Krumholtz Mountains\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Krumholtz Mountains</a>, come prepared with a gift or performance. The clan of sprites who live in these icy cliffs are extremely private, and will deny access to those who do not bring someone to offer for their passage. Those who try to cheat them can be lost for hundreds of years, or find themselves a permanent exhibit in the fairy queen's tower. <br>\nWinter's strength is drawn from its close ties to the elemental planes, and the courtiers will defend the balance with their lives. Events that disrupt the careful harmony will not be tolerated. No matter their private allegiances, all able Winterlings will stand together against whatever threatens their Court and Realm. <br>\nUnlike the other Seasonal Courts, Winter has a...looser relationship with death and spirits. It is not unusual to meet a reborn or halfdead - these are intelligent beings that exist in a sort of different timeline. Additionally, there are multiple festivals and holy days dedicated to greeting spirits of those who have passed on long ago.

Some of the oldest records in the universe can be found in the dryads' libraries. Scholars from across the realms come here to study and learn, and many study their whole life without leaving again. Autumn has the deepest connections to beasts and fauna - many have remarkable control over druidic wildshaping skills. Some Autumn courtiers live their entire life in the cities at the center of each archfey's forest, never once walking upon the ground itself. In some places, the trees reach up past the clouds, and it is said that if you climb high enough, you will find giants living in stone clouds that levitate miles above the ground.<br>\nEach forest has a certain amount of autonomy, but all are united in their deep roots and ancient histories. Autumn may lack in military strength or technological advances, but the knowledge and texts curated by the archfey are priceless.<br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"Autumn book.png\" src=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/images/autumn-book.png\" target=\"_self\"> <br><a data-href=\"Spring\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/spring/spring.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spring</a><br>Court Information\n<br><br> The Alabaster Palace of <a data-href=\"Pandorum's Resolve\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/spring/pandorum's-resolve.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Pandorum's Resolve</a> is widely regarded as the most luxurious city in the realm and beyond. The season also boasts of renowned military and arcane universities which have developed remarkable advancements in enchantment and illusion magic. Spring has some of the most vibrant and varied biomes - local flora with unique healing and revitalizing properties found nowhere else in the multiverse. It is said that the sun never fully sets in Spring - and that dawn takes all morning to complete. <br><br><a data-href=\"Summer\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/summer/summer.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Summer</a><br>Court Information\n<br><br>Summer is the most technologically advanced of any of the seasons, developing steam power, airships, and more. Most of the arable land is taken up with farming, and Summer grows the bulk of the grains eaten across the entire plane. Slinking through the whole Season is a massive chain of mountains which is said to shimmer like the scales of the Platinum Dragon himself at sunrise and sunset.<br>\nSummer boasts of a magnificent airship fleet, the most advanced of the Season's Courts. Summer is also famous for having learned to work with rare and unusual materials, utilizing dangerous substances like cold iron, quicksilver, and even lightning itself. The Quellwrights who handle these deadly materials are both feared and respected for their knowledge and skill. <br><a data-href=\"Winter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter</a><br>Court Information\n<br><br>Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps.<br>\nMuch of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to both elementals and beastfolk. <br><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Locations/Feywild/Winter/Scarlet Maple.md\" data-href=\"Locations/Feywild/Winter/Scarlet Maple.md\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/scarlet-maple.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Scarlet Maple</a> (City)<br><br><a data-href=\"Obsidian Range\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/obsidian-range/obsidian-range.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Obsidian Range</a><br>Court Information\n<br><br>Obsidian Range - a sort of Feywild equivalent to the <a data-href=\"Underdark\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Underdark\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Underdark</a>, with deep reaching chasms and even some passages that lead to <a data-href=\"Shadowfel\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/shadowfel/shadowfel.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Shadowfel</a>, if you survive the passage.

It is a raging everstorm that can only be navigated by the most skilled crews and ships. But if you can find your way through the maelstroms and jagged coral ridges (not to mention the incredible wildlife), the reward is phenomenal: amphibious communities with incredible culture that touch the elemental planes of Water, Air, Lighting, and Thunder - though only when the conditions are right. Their proximity to these planes gives them access to power and resources unavailable in the rest of the realm. <br>\n<br> <br><br>Plane description\n<br><br>The Material Plane is called <a data-href=\"Rakāuvi\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/rakāuvi.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Rakāuvi</a>. Common creation legends tell of the first seven trees the grew up out of the center of the world. From each tree came unique people and creatures, favored by this god or that. Today, only the remnants of most of those great trees still exist, but the people and their ancient communities are still there. <br><a data-href=\"Ashitaya\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/ashitaya/ashitaya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ashitaya</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br><a data-href=\"Ashitaya\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/ashitaya/ashitaya.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Ashitaya</a>, derived from an old halfling dialect, translates to \"Eternal Oak.\" This continent is home to an enormous and ancient oak tree that serves as the heart and soul of the land, its acorns are said to possess incredible healing properties and are sought after by many. There are no cities or towns here, as the people shun organized society, so those who seek the blessed acorns must venture in themselves - or pay massive prices of those bold enough to enter the forest. Here, the god of the First Oak walks among the people, his footsteps like thunder. <br><a data-href=\"Baheera\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Baheera</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br>The sun-drenched continent of Baheera looks like a perfect paradise of sand dunes and lush rainforests. The name Baheera means \"Oasis of Life\" in the orcish language, and many people here live nomadic lifestyles, herding magnificent beasts said to carry small villages on their backs. Deep in the center of the largest desert one can find a massive plateau where a great Djinn lives, their home hidden in a perpetual sandstorm. <br><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakāuvi/Baheera/Arkehost Oasis/Arkehost Oasis.md\" data-href=\"Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakāuvi/Baheera/Arkehost Oasis/Arkehost Oasis.md\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/arkehost-oasis/arkehost-oasis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Arkehost Oasis</a> (City)<br><a data-href=\"Hallowhymn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/hallowhymn/hallowhymn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hallowhymn</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br>Taking its name from the ancient elvish word \"Halinhyr,\" which means \"Sacred Grove,\" Hallowhymn is an island continent of intense wild magic. Tales tell of the trees here emitting melodious and haunting tunes, some say they sway in an ethereal dance, captivating any who dare disrespect the law of the wood elves who call this island home. Most villages and cities on the Hallowhym islands are accessible only by climbing or swimming. <br><a data-href=\"Nordthorn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Nordthorn</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br>This frigid continent's icy landscapes are dotted with massive snow-covered pine forests, and the continent is known for its resilience and unforgiving nature.

A majority of Rakauvi's population lives here in Sylvari. <br><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakāuvi/Sylvari/Court of Aetheria.md\" data-href=\"Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakāuvi/Sylvari/Court of Aetheria.md\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/sylvari/court-of-aetheria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Court of Aetheria</a> (Country)<br><a data-href=\"Umbrosia\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/umbrosia/umbrosia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Umbrosia</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br>Umbrosia is the land of the mythical Tree of Shadows, a place even devils and demons fear. This continent, shrouded in perpetual darkness, is home to strange bioluminescent flora and fauna. The twisted trees in Umbrosia seem to bend and morph with the shifting shadows, giving the whole land an eerie and mystical atmosphere. Magic behaves oddly here, making Umbrosia a destination for many mages and curious researchers, many of whom build towers or outposts to conduct their experiments. <br><a data-href=\"Yewdon\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/yewdon/yewdon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Yewdon</a><br>Continent description\n<br><br>A haunted continent dominated by the sprawling Yewwood Forest, cloaked in a literal layer of magic.
