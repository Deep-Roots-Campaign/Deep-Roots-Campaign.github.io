That … wound up yielding disturbing insights into the nature of soul disappearances across the planes. The idea that someone – guess who … – might be amassing souls to \"brute force\" their way into godhood is chilling. This isn't about the handful trapped here, however abhorrent that might already be. This concerns dozens, hundreds, likely even thousands.<br>My father's meticulous research, despite the personal toll it took on him, paints a picture of a vast, shadowy conspiracy. He sought to gain <a data-href=\"the Raven Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Raven Queen</a>'s favour to gain an audience with her to learn what she knew ( or not ) about the ultimate fate of these souls, as even tracing the path of the river Styx itself yielded no results, apparently.<br>The revelation about the Raven Queen's ascension from a fey entity known as the <a data-href=\"Chrysalis Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Chrysalis Queen\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrysalis Queen</a> to a goddess during the <a data-href=\"Spellplague\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/terms-and-phrases/spellplague.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spellplague</a> provides historical context for the kind of transformation <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan</a> might be attempting. While this might once have been an inspiring tale, it instills me with dread now.<br>What cosmic measure of power are we truly up against?<br>A sound question to ask, especially in light of our failure to clean these bloody ( literally and figuratively ) handprints, these anchor points, off the floor.<br>We decided to look around for more clues. <a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> and <a data-href=\"Smoke-in-Mirrors\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Smoke-in-Mirrors\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Smoke-in-Mirrors</a> came across a particularly interesting chamber, containing a message written in blood about becoming a vessel for the Abyss is particularly unsettling.

The inactive spell reminiscent of Leomund's Tiny Hut – according to the more arcanely experienced – suggests our efforts to disrupt the ritual may be having some effect. That's at least somewhat heartening.<br>Mirri and I meanwhile uncovered some items in the ransacked library, including a musical scroll for creating a necklace of prayer beads. The recurring themes of various gemstones in the lyrics feel significant. When I've put together my notes on precious crystals and the like, I would like to compare them to what purpose the poems states these materials will play:<br>“Oak for strength;<br>\nCoral to guide;<br>\nJade for purification;<br>\nAmber for protection;<br>\nOnyx to empower;<br>\nAquamarine for my foundation.”<br>Perhaps once Deidre has had a look – as we believed she in particular would appreciate the items we found. <br>We later ventured into the underground chamber beneath the tree root system, which was both awe-inspiring and horrifying. The bioluminescent plants created a mesmerising atmosphere, but the discovery of countless skulls embedded in the tree roots and the bedding of the small lake spoke of immense suffering.<br>Unfortunately, it didn't take much in terms of what I thought was careful exploration for us to be faced with the threat of Will-o'-Wisps – manifestations of anguished souls. Formidable foes as they might be, we've overcome worse odds before. I mean, we ( though I least of all ) took down a dragon!

Their carefree interaction was a poignant reminder of the simple joys I nowadays often overlook …<br>Upon our return below ground ( with our furry companions, Luck included ), we wound up in a chamber that appears to be a shrine to the <a data-href=\"Serenity of the Sisters\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Serenity of the Sisters\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Serenity of the Sisters</a> — precisely whom <a data-href=\"Wisp\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Wisp</a> had advised us to seek!<br>The altars, or rather pools, dedicated to various goddesses and powerful entities like <a data-href=\"Faen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/faen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Faen</a>, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Meilikki\" data-href=\"Meilikki\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/meilikki.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mielikki</a>, <a data-href=\"the Librarian\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/the Librarian\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Librarian</a>, <a data-href=\"Carroway\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Carroway\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Carroway</a>, <a data-href=\"Amara\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Amara\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Amara</a>, and <a data-href=\"Dahma\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Dahma\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Dahma</a>, offer a wealth of potential aid and knowledge. The inclusion of the Librarian, a rebel archfey whose primary concern – as far as I know – is to spread knowledge, among their number is particularly intriguing and potentially useful in our struggle, or various struggles.<br>The mural on the ceiling, depicting \"the beast who devours the sun,\" meanwhile revealed crucial information about the nature of eclipses in the Feywild. The sun here isn't merely a source of light, but a portal to other realms, shifting dangerously during an eclipse. In its usual state, it should lead to the <a data-href=\"Fire Plane\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Fire Plane\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Fire Plane</a>. Fitting enough, but the revelation about the sun being a rift between worlds didn't stop there: it leads into the <a data-href=\"Abyss\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Abyss</a> as it shifts towards a total eclipse, before opening a way into the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shadowfel\" data-href=\"Shadowfel\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/shadowfel/shadowfel.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Shadowfell</a> for the briefest of moments once total darkness is attained, only for the pattern to then be reversed again.<br>As nightmarish a finding as this is given the circumstances, this could very well be the key to understanding <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan</a>'s ultimate goal. The warning –&nbsp;or challenge –&nbsp;about the risks and potential rewards of being out during an eclipse cements the conviction that he seeks to manipulate the next upcoming eclipse. Now that spiel about ‘blotting out the sun’ makes even more sense …<br>Either way, I now await word from Wisp. I hope she knows when the next eclipse here will occur. As a druid of the Circle of Stars, she of all people might have an idea about this, I suppose.<br><a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> meanwhile put up quite the show, enticing lustermites to dance to her tune and uncovering a slew of additional names belonging to the Serenity of the Sisters – before she decides to drink from Mielikki's pool. Now, I am not wont to mistrust deities per se, but this to me seemed an unnecessarily brazen move. However, the Feywild and the powers that be there have a way of proving me wrong at every turn: the mouthful of water yielded a mysterious diamond.<br>All in all: a strange blend of dire discovery and light-hearted communication, at least until <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a>'s communion with <a data-href=\"Hallow\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Hallow</a> went awry. A gut-wrenching scream heralded her return to the here and now before storming out of the shrine.<br>( Was Hallow perhaps no longer there, or wounded, or no longer herself, even? Did the locathi get to either of them? )<br>\nI had to chase after her. How could I not, even against the odds that she might not even want to see me or anyone else as she confronted … whatever pains that happening stirred to life?<br>Her anguish, the blood, the scrubbing and the cryptic mantra about being \"the harbinger of her own fate\" hint at a burden far heavier than I had imagined.<br>She kept staring at her reflection in the water. Her refusal to truly tell me who she expected to see there – or perhaps was afraid to see – was expected, but hard to swallow all the same. She referenced the scar on her cheek from a previous encounter in which she chose honesty regarding what she deemed plain to see as a reason not to do so. It hurts to think she might believe her present company could do such a thing to her, but then … how can I blame or even judge her? We don't all deal with pain by sharing it.<br>She also referred the promise she made to get me home — a risky thing I believe, now we know what we know about promise magic. This, I don't fully understand. How does that impact her ability to be truthful? The depth of her trauma and the secrets she carries are obviously taking a toll, and I worry about the impact this will have on our her, our objective and our group as a whole.<br>Ah … shit, I don't know. If there's anything I've learned, it's that I know very little, and can infer even less.<br>For now, we have more work to do. The information about the eclipse and its potential role in Vestan's plans adds to our urgency, so we must swiftly decipher these clues, harness any power and wisdom offered by the Serenity of the Sisters, and find a way to stop Vestan before he can manipulate these cosmic forces for his sinister purposes.","aliases":[],"tags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Aerendyl 42","level":1,"id":"Aerendyl 42"}],"backlinks":[],"links":["locations/feywild/feywild.html","entities/npcs/alixandria.html","Underfey","entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html","entities/animal-companions/grout.html","entities/animal-companions/ralph.html","Serenity of the Sisters","entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html","entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/faen.html","entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/meilikki.html","the Librarian","Carroway","Amara","Dahma","Fire Plane","locations/abyss/abyss.html","locations/shadowfel/shadowfel.html","Vestan Tlanbourn","entities/player-characters/deidre.html","entities/player-characters/mirri.html","entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-42.html","pathToRoot":"..","createdTime":1723485935674,"modifiedTime":1723487642738,"sourceSize":5489,"sourcePath":"Character Logs/Aerendyl 42.md","exportPath":"character-logs/aerendyl-42.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"attachments":[]},"character-logs/aerendyl-43.html":{"title":"Aerendyl 43","icon":"","description":"<br>[ * Spoiler-tagged parts are speculations re: Vestan and who he is to Mirri lmao ]<br>\nDay 3 of Firecrest, T.A. 515? | Day 12 in the Feywild<br>\n<a data-href=\"Toraash\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Toraash\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Toraash</a>’s disgruntlement at the revelation surrounding the mural overhead drew me back towards them; into the staff, I suppose.

Her story shook us to our core. She had been married to Vestan, known to her as Tyvan, and bore him a child named <a data-href=\"Kamina\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Kamina\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamina</a> before he took off. This hit <a data-href=\"Mirri\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mirri</a> hard; I watched a storm of emotions cross her face — confusion, disbelief, raw envy – or jealousy? – and unbounded grief to cap it off.<br> I know the thought has crossed my mind before,<br>Spoiler\nthat Vestan is Mirri’s father, <br>and in particular the envy reinforces that theory.

The possibility that Kamina, <br>Spoiler\npotentially Mirri's half-sibling, <br>might have been Vestan's latest victim, instills as much sorrow in me as it does ire. I cannot imagine the heartbreak it took for Merisande to reach us …<br>\nSpeaking of her: she referred to us by some cryptic titles: I am \"The Gate,\" Mirri \"The Sword,\" Deidre \"The Jewel,\" and Luck \"The Knight\", if i recall correctly. Curiously, she couldn't \"see\" Corvaux at all. I’m not sure if she meant ‘see’ in her prophetic dreams, or ‘see’ past their physical form here, in the physical world. I wonder if these designations are more of a product of our lives until now, or if they’re meant to be prophetic.<br>In any case: we've agreed to include Merisande in our plans. We don’t know how exactly, but we’ll come to that before we depart, I presume. However, Mirri's private conversation with her leaves me uneasy. I caught glimpses of Merisande's anxiety and eagerness, but Mirri's reaction remains a mystery.

Either way, I made sure to say goodbye on Toraash’ behalf before we left.<br>After that, I worked on a ring for myself; something to help replace the forefinger I lost in <a data-href=\"Baheera\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakāuvi/baheera/baheera.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Baheera</a>, albeit with a little extra functionality. <a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a>'s help was incredibly useful. The job isn't done yet, but we're well on our way. I've also made sure we have plenty of powdered silver and iron, and while rummaging through my pack, I also discovered I had more holy water that I just forgot about. It's all about the little things, right?<br>I also asked <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Meilikki\" data-href=\"Meilikki\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/meilikki.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Mielikki</a> for some water from her pond.

That, and refilling my waterskin, of course. For all the caution we've had to employ in terms of giving back when we take something, a small seed from the dreamgrass flower she appreciated last time only seemed fitting.

I think this is only the second time since he joined our little band of misfits that I've had a moment alone with him, actually. I'm happy I got around to having a conversation with him in private, as it led to me trusting him with the acorn of resurrection. Of course I would have rather held on to it myself, but I know that is only the difficulty of relinquishing control speaking. At least it's not greed; I'll take comfort in that.<br>I simply figured with his focus homing in on his allegiance to <a data-href=\"the Raven Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Raven Queen</a> and her tenets, he will be the least likely to abuse it – whether intentionally or not –, along with myself. Although our reasons for it may be different, with myself seeking to maintain the delicate balance between life and death, and him … not necessarily, I suppose, the point stands. Besides, who knows where I might wind up once we encounter <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" data-href=\"Vestan Tlanbourn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Vestan Tlanbourn\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Vestan</a>.

Granted, it almost went sideways and I think it would've taken only one more loss of focus for us both to tumble into one of those pools around us, but it panned out in the end.

He does remind me of <a data-href=\"Paelias\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Paelias\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Paelias</a> in so many ways, but that is not an excuse. Everything reminds me of Paelias… that is the nature of grief, I suppose. You cannot outrun it; it does not leave you.<br>\nWhen we were all gathered again, I told my friends about my theory and we discussed his purpose here once more. Aeren recalled special properties of the <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> court, of its importance in stories.

I’ve heard of her myself—a few friends in the Guild used to invoke her when their heists just weren’t turning out right.

The journal chronicles Malachai’s attempts to find out where souls were disappearing. He’s faced obyrith, fae, demons, etc., as well as experimented and attempted to create new spells that might assist his journey. There were details about elvish souls that should have reincarnated, mortals who vanished into the <a data-href=\"Feywild\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Feywild</a> under strange circumstances… He performed “errands” for <a data-href=\"the Raven Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Raven Queen</a> and searched the River Styx. And yet all he could find was that dark shadows have shrouded some black hole that has presumably been “consuming” these souls… thousands upon thousands of them.<br>That kind of power could be used, Malachai surmises, to brute-force an ascension to divinity.

It means his soul is safe, for the time being. Perhaps I can find a way to free him, too. To let him find peace at last.<br>Only one other being has attempted this ascension to godhood before; the Raven Queen herself. She was previously the <a data-href=\"Chrysalis Queen\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Chrysalis Queen\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrysalis Queen</a> of <a data-href=\"Winter\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter</a> before she ruled the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shadowfel\" data-href=\"Shadowfel\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/shadowfel/shadowfel.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Shadowfell</a>. But the ascension was not perfect; something went wrong in some way and she became… peculiar. Part of that may have been because of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Spellplague\" data-href=\"Spellplague\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/terms-and-phrases/spellplague.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Spell Plague</a>, which coincided with her preparations. So, either he knows of some coming cataclysm or he’s simply attempting to brute-force it. I can’t decide which is worse.<br>We decided to explore the rest of this place before making any grand decision. There may be hints left behind that we have not yet seen. We paired off—<a data-href=\"Deidre\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Deidre</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Smoke-in-Mirrors\" data-href=\"Smoke-in-Mirrors\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Smoke-in-Mirrors\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Smoke</a>, Corvaux and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Luck of the Draw\" data-href=\"Luck of the Draw\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Luck</a>, Aeren and myself. We searched a library and adjoining bedroom, finding little of note. Most of the books contained lists of <a data-href=\"Autumn\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Autumn</a> authority captains and scouts. We did find an intact scroll that contained musical instructions for making prayer beads. A gift for Deidre, perhaps? In the bedroom, we found an emerald green and gold leaf cloak, a bark-brocade vest, and some cufflinks. The cloak is mine, of course—it’s very nearly the same shade as my doublet!<br>We met up again in the central room where Corvaux and Luck explained that they had found an entrance to a basement.

It was mostly rubble that we had to squeeze through, bumping and bruising ourselves as we went. If the basement of Deidre’s manor was terrible, this one was worse. There were bones embedded into the roots of the tree and many more in the shallow water. Across the shallow pool, I found myself mired in muck as I pushed past an ivy curtain into a massive chamber. But our exploration halted to a stop there—we heard Luck and Deidre in danger, and rushed across the cavern to help them.

While we rested and those who were wounded recuperated… I wandered back into the main cavern.<br>The water was murky, but still enough for me to catch a glimpse of my reflection. The swirling aurora was still there in my eyes and I was starting to wonder if the effect was permanent. The thought of it left me… conflicted. I focused on the pattern, on my appearance as a whole. I have magic now that can change it, far easier than any costume or cosmetic I’ve used before, and when I opened my eyes again, they were back to normal. Dark hazel brown. So I do have some control over it!<br>What I did next was purely selfish. Self-indulgent. Something I had never dared attempt before… I changed my eyes again. As soft and green as the fields of Orllanar. To see my face staring back at me with their eyes… It was surreal. It brought up a thousand “what-ifs”, things I had wondered all my life. Would it have been easier if I looked like this instead of…<br>Back to brown. The green doesn’t suit me. I wish it did.<br>We decided that our time here would be longer than originally expected.

Smoke excitedly said that this must be a temple to Mielikki and her sisters. But my greatest surprise was that there was a shrine to <a data-href=\"the Librarian\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/the Librarian\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">the Librarian</a> here.<br>The moment Smoke and Deidre stepped away, I tried to invoke her. Do you pray to an Archfey like you do the gods? I haven’t done that since I was a small girl, but I had to try. I asked for help defeating him. And, if I must be specific… I asked about the <a data-href=\"Eldoumiir\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Eldoumiir\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Eldoumiir</a> Line. It has been on my mind since before we arrived here in the Feywild—the <a data-href=\"Archive\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Archive\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Archive</a> said he was a descendant of that line. The root of all of this—literally &amp; figuratively— may lie with them. Who were they? What happened to them? Are they still around? Will I find <a data-href=\"Xyrra\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Xyrra\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Xyrra</a>’s name among them or was she a lie, too?<br>It wasn’t until Aeren returned with Luck that we understood exactly where we were; this is the <a data-href=\"Serenity of the Sisters\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Serenity of the Sisters\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Serenity of the Sisters</a>!<br>What joy I felt at knowing this was soon snatched away as Aeren began to translate the <a data-href=\"Druidic\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/languages/druidic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Druidic</a> text on the ceiling mural. The <a data-href=\"Sun Devourer\" href=\"https://deep-roots-campaign.github.io/Sun Devourer\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">Sun Devourer</a>.

Fuck. Fuck! So this is how he means to do it? His ascent delivered on a silver spoon with this doorway?<br>And yet… it might also be a chance I have to take.

The very thought of it is madness, that I might walk in his footsteps in any way, but it’s something to keep in mind. Maybe the Librarian can help me with that, too. I don’t know, nor do I have enough faith in the archfey to risk it. What I do know is that I at least owe it to Hallow to tell her what we’ve learned as soon as possible. The others are exploring the temple. Aeren and Deidre are talking—didn’t they pray at the shrine in the manor? Maybe they’re trying again. Corvaux’s gone to peer into that deep crevice at the final pool. I’ve decided to sit by the Librarian’s shrine and try to reach Hallow.
